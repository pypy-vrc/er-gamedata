Skin/Desc/1001001┃If you hear her humming, maybe run the other direction.
Skin/Desc/1001002┃A rose by any other name would also have thorns.
Skin/Desc/1001003┃There are people who make rules... and people who break them.
Skin/Desc/1002001┃She's been on patrol for five hours.\nI think shes... lost?
Skin/Desc/1003001┃Her eyes sparkled like the glint of her blade.\nOne must always fight to preserve their honor. 
Skin/Desc/1003002┃All for one, and one for all.
Skin/Desc/1004001┃Kiss the ring to show your respect.
Skin/Desc/1004002┃How do I look? It takes a real man to rock flowers.
Skin/Desc/1005001┃The glint will be the last thing you see before the darkness.
Skin/Desc/1005002┃It's time for my experiment.
Skin/Desc/1006001┃Focus and aim. Don't make them suffer.
Skin/Desc/1006002┃My my, what big teeth you have!
Skin/Desc/1006003┃Only the strongest wolf can lead its pack.
Skin/Desc/1007001┃Sometimes, the only way to end an argument is to use your fists.
Skin/Desc/1007002┃It's hot down here. Must be in the right place.
Skin/Desc/1007003┃You want to fight? Heh, I guess I can spare a couple minutes.
Skin/Desc/1007004┃I can do even better than this.
Skin/Desc/1008001┃Today's performance is gonna be incredible! Heh, it might even change the world.
Skin/Desc/1008002┃Let's.. let's start the show.
Skin/Desc/1009001┃It's the end of the world. Better be prepared.
Skin/Desc/1009002┃Demons are demons. Their pasts are... irrelevant.
Skin/Desc/1010001┃The nomad life ain't so bad. I have nowhere to go and nobody looking for me.
Skin/Desc/1010002┃This? It's.. uh... just water.
Skin/Desc/1010003┃Don't worry, Dragon Dailin is here to ward off all those pesky evil spirits following you around!
Skin/Desc/1011001┃A model student who treats every training exercise as if it were the real thing.
Skin/Desc/1011002┃As gentle as a breeze or as strong as a raging tempest.
Skin/Desc/1011003┃It seems like a whole new world awaits us.
Skin/Desc/1012001┃Their destinies are just like magnolias - blooming white but slowly and surely fading darker.
Skin/Desc/1012002┃I've always been destined for greatness. 
Skin/Desc/1012003┃It is my destiny to bring the wandering souls to peace.
Skin/Desc/1013001┃Sushi isn't easy to make, but the time it takes to cook a fish is nothing compared to the time that fish spent living and... dreaming?
Skin/Desc/1013002┃If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a flaming volleyball with a drawing of a dumpling on it. 
Skin/Desc/1014001┃Sinners, prepare to face your judgement. 
Skin/Desc/1014002┃Guidance to the lost. Salvation to the damned.
Skin/Desc/1015001┃Holding onto life like a clover holding onto the ground in the frost. 
Skin/Desc/1015002┃I...tried something a little different today. Wilson too.
Skin/Desc/1015003┃Do you like snow? I.. I guess I don't hate it...
Skin/Desc/1016001┃How'd you like to feel the midnight breeze flow through your hair?
Skin/Desc/1016002┃Your Games. Your Devices. Play Anywhere.
Skin/Desc/1017001┃Where should I start the first fire?\nEh, doesn't matter. It'll all just burn anyway!
Skin/Desc/1017002┃Kill it with fire!
Skin/Desc/1018001┃I really don't care who you're trying to silence.\nI only care that the check clears.
Skin/Desc/1018002┃I love a good carnival. Nobody expects any danger during a celebration. 
Skin/Desc/1019001┃Today's entree will be delicious, sir!
Skin/Desc/1019002┃Trick or Treat! I worked super hard on my costume this year!
Skin/Desc/1020001┃Settle down now, little ones. I wouldn't want to raise my voice.
Skin/Desc/1020002┃I hope they don't mind if I crash their party, but I'm in the mood for some fun.
Skin/Desc/1020004┃Don't get too close - or you'll never escape.
Skin/Desc/1021001┃Target confirmed. Proceeding with mission.
Skin/Desc/1021002┃Looks may deceive... but bullets won't.
Skin/Desc/1022001┃Order something shaken, not stirred.
Skin/Desc/1022002┃My bad! I just gotta clean up ALL the garbage...
Skin/Desc/1023001┃After the war is over, can you really call one side victorious?
Skin/Desc/1023002┃C'mon, it won't hurt. I just need to tweak you a little more.
Skin/Desc/1024001┃Always make the first move towards victory.
Skin/Desc/1025001┃Don't overthink. Keep your head down. Survive.
Skin/Desc/1026001┃I can get more horsepower out of anything. Even a toaster!!
Skin/Desc/1027001┃Mission complete. On to the next one.
Skin/Desc/1028001┃I hope class ends soon. I gotta go to the library.
Skin/Desc/1028002┃Remember, every new year is the first page of your new story.
Skin/Desc/1029001┃Time to put all that swimming to good use.
Skin/Desc/1030001┃Today's stream will be particularly sweet!
Skin/Desc/1031001┃My arrow will cleanse the unholy.
Skin/Desc/1031002┃May justice guide my arrow!
Skin/Desc/1031003┃My arrow will expel the darkness!
Skin/Desc/1032001┃It's been a while since I've been this cold. Well, happy holidays I suppose.
Skin/Desc/1033001┃You really came here without a plan? Heh, bold.
Skin/Desc/1034001┃I'll try my best to capture all of this perfect scenery through the lens of my camera.
Skin/Desc/1035001┃A good fight always starts with the right mindset. Remember that.
Skin/Desc/1036001┃The stars once acted as a celestial compass to guide those who were lost.\nI hope I can be someone like that to you.
Skin/Desc/1037001┃What a mess. Time to patch things up.
Skin/Desc/1038001┃You didn't see anything. It'd be wise for you to remember that.
Skin/Desc/1039001┃Much like the impossible blue rose, I took a white orchid and turned it blue. 
Skin/Desc/1040001┃We'll take good care of you.
Skin/Desc/1044001┃Don't bother begging. Your life's already over.
Skin/Desc/1041001┃The holy flame brings light to darkness.
Skin/Desc/1042001┃Who dares wake me up from my slumber?
Skin/Desc/1043001┃There's no bomb I can't defuse.
Skin/Desc/1045001┃So, where's my seat?
Skin/Desc/1046001┃I feel bad, but... Your story ends here. 
Skin/Desc/1047001┃Time to leave. Ta ta for now~
Skin/Desc/1036002┃If this will let someone else have a normal life, then it's worth it.
Skin/Desc/1028003┃I wonder what kind of story the ocean will tell me today.
Skin/Desc/1029002┃I feel fully in my element here.
Skin/Desc/1031004┃You're blocking the sun. Could you move?
Skin/Desc/1033002┃Just go all out? C'mon, at least give me a script!
Skin/Desc/1048001┃With my brush in hand, the world is my canvas!
Skin/Desc/1049001┃Ticket looks good! Have a wonderful time at Lumialand!
Skin/Desc/1051001┃May this melody never wither.
Skin/Desc/1052001┃I can show you the way, but only you can choose your path.
Skin/Desc/1050001┃I only dance for myself.
Skin/Desc/1054001┃Listen up, stupid: don't you dare underestimate the ocean.
Skin/Desc/1053001┃The weak die off. The strong live on.
Skin/Desc/1055001┃This is my turf. I'm going in!
Skin/Desc/1056001┃The only things you can never have too much of are practice... and money.
Skin/Desc/1002002┃Can we do this again next year? Together?
Skin/Desc/1022003┃We have to clean ALL of this? Well, we better get started.
Skin/Desc/1016003┃Thanks for waiting, here's your order!
Skin/Desc/1018003┃Call me for the best service in town.
Skin/Desc/1030002┃You better not be late! Or you won't get dessert.
Skin/Desc/1057001┃Let's keep our eyes on the compass.
Skin/Desc/1026002┃There's nowhere I can't reach. I have no limits.
Skin/Desc/1025002┃There are things that can't be fixed with prayers..
Skin/Desc/1043002┃Which do you prefer: a tangy flavor, or the kind that bursts in your mouth?
Skin/Desc/1058001┃Even the worst enemies can become potential partners.
Skin/Desc/1019003┃Are you ready for the show?
Skin/Desc/1003003┃A sword is just like wine: cold and smooth. 
Skin/Desc/1008003┃All I need are my guitar and my amp, and it's showtime!
Skin/Desc/1012004┃Effort is more important than fate.
Skin/Desc/1037002┃I'll show you who I really am behind this mask.
Skin/Desc/1038002┃An actor's strength isn't their good looks, but their unyielding confidence.
Skin/Desc/1060001┃Art is finding beauty where there's only destruction.
Skin/Desc/1059001┃I'll have your back! ...If you have mine. 
Skin/Desc/1045002┃Clothes can be like wings. Now's the perfect time to prove it!
Skin/Desc/1024002┃I am the owner of my dreams, the master of my fate.
Skin/Desc/1050002┃Make sure to come on time. I will wait for no one.
Skin/Desc/1061001┃I know I'm cute but don't underestimate me! 
Skin/Desc/1010004┃Give me some snacks or I'll eat you!
Skin/Desc/1011004┃You can tell who's evil by how much they smell.
Skin/Desc/1007005┃If you don't want to get hit, stay the hell outta my way.
Skin/Desc/1009003┃It's a good night for a fresh start.
Skin/Desc/1040002┃Thanks for sticking with me for another year.\n<color=#10adff>That's what Nina should say!</color>
Skin/Desc/1036003┃Are you ready for your present?
Skin/Desc/1013003┃I'm ready for my mascot debut!
Skin/Desc/1047002┃The more things you have, the more you have to lose.
Skin/Desc/1027002┃Puzzles and cases have one thing in common: they both want to be solved.
Skin/Desc/1015004┃Please don't touch my display items... Wilson's watching.
Skin/Desc/1062001┃It's up to us to finish the job.
Skin/Desc/1049002┃Play smart. Win more. OP.GG
Skin/Desc/1032002┃Let me teach you how to survive in this place.
Skin/Desc/1063001┃Is that the best plan you've got?
Skin/Desc/1033003┃Beat it! I don't have time to waste on you!
Skin/Desc/1041002┃The flame of purification will wash you away.
Skin/Desc/1050003┃Let me remind you what your duty as a student is.
Skin/Desc/1048002┃I wonder what power the colors of my magic hold.
Skin/Desc/1004003┃You call yourself a rebel? Pathetic!
Skin/Desc/1044002┃Show me what you're made of.
Skin/Desc/1042002┃Fortunately, you're on time. I guess you deserve a compliment.
Skin/Desc/1039002┃Being loved is the most beautiful thing in the world!
Skin/Desc/1064001┃Not all dreams are happy.
Skin/Desc/1035002┃Determination isn't enough. You need to be ready for anything.
Skin/Desc/1055002┃Ready to stop, drop, and roll?
Skin/Desc/1031005┃My arrows will illuminate the way.
Skin/Desc/1034002┃How am I supposed to choose one photo to showcase my travels...
Skin/Desc/1017003┃Master, if you're cold, I can turn up the heat... hehe...
Skin/Desc/1046002┃If you're in hot water, I'm your guy.
Skin/Desc/1020003┃Let's see what is hiding in those treasure chests!
Skin/Desc/1051002┃I just thought of the perfect lyrics! I need to write them down!

CharacterGuide/1┃Jackie's tactic is her Continuity of Choices. The ideal situation is to activate her Hack & Slash(Q) skill first. You can then deal extra damage to the enemies that are bleeding and recover HP from the lifesteal effect by using Adrenaline Burst (W). Use Leaping Strike (E) to make your enemies move slower right after Adrenaline Burst. You can also reduce the distance between you and the enemy by combining Adrenaline Burst and Leaping Strike.
CharacterGuide/2┃Aya is a long-distance character that requires different strategies depending on the weapon she has. Steady Shot (W) is a powerful skill, but it is hard to hit the enemy as you cannot change directions while using it. However, it is good when paired with Blank Cartridge (R), which makes the enemy stop. You can then suppress the enemy or shake them off by shooting in their direction while walking backwards.
CharacterGuide/3┃Fiora gains stacks of Touché (passive) for every basic attack, applying an indicator. She then attacks enemies by proccing the activated Touché indicator. To gain stacks of Touché quickly, you need to use Attaque Composée (W) often, as it allows you to perform basic attacks twice in a row. You can deal extra damage to enemies with full stacks by using Fente (Q) or Marche & Rompre (E).\nToggle her ultimate, Garde (R), to deal extra damage. When toggled, each attack uses SP, so keep an eye on it! 
CharacterGuide/4┃Magnus' main attack is 17 vs 1 (W). In order to maximize the effectiveness of this skill, you need to hit the opponent with Broken Bullet (Q), reducing their speed. Thanks to Tough Body (passive), Magnus also gets scarier every time he loses HP, making the 17 vs 1 (W) skill even stronger as it also increases his defense power. His ultimate, Bike From Hell, is a skill used for long-distance engagements, making it good for finishing off escaping enemies.
CharacterGuide/5┃\nWhen Zahir hits an enemy with one of his skills, it applies an Eye of Azrael (passive) indicator to them. There are specific Eye of Azrael effects for each skills, so when hitting an enemy that has the Eye of Azrael indicator, you will have enhanced combat potential thanks to the additional effects.\nZahir's skills are mostly skill shots, so it can be hard to hit the enemy. To make things easier, hit them first with Vayvayastra (E) to knock them airborne and then use Narayanastra (Q) or Gandiva (W). You have to acquire Chakrams to use Gandiva (W), but the cooldown is rather short, so you can deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time.\nHis ultimate, Bhargavastra (R), is a powerful attack in a certain range, so it is more effective when used with a debuff that prevents them from exiting that range.
CharacterGuide/6┃Nadine's strength is to be fast. If you use Monkey Wire (E) to increase your attack speed, you will be able to attack even faster. You can also reduce the enemy's movement speed with Squirrel Trap (W), keeping distance between you and them, turning the fight to your advantage.\nFor her ultimate, Wolf Assault, you need to slay a lot of wild animals. Slaying wild animals gives your more stacks of Wild & Clairvoyant (passive), which increases the damage dealt by the summoned wolf.
CharacterGuide/7┃Hyunwoo is a character with strong defense power. After increasing his defense with Bluff (W), you can reduce your enemy's defense by stunning them with First Attack (E), while gaining defense at the same time. If you succeeded in hitting the target with his ultimate skill, he deals the most damage in a short amount of time.
CharacterGuide/8┃Hart's attacks vary not only depending on her Skill Enhancements, but also depending on her <color=yellow>Skill Evolution</color> points, thus making strategic decisions is important. You can use apply a max of two Skill Evolution points per skill. Additional effects are applied to the skills depending on if the skill has been evolved. You gain 1 Skill Evolution point the first you craft an Uncommon, Rare, or Epic weapon, for a total of 3 points.\nHart's attack power increases with how long she charges her skill, Delay(Q). Hart is free to move around as she pleases while charging, so you can increase your attack power first with Overdrive (W), and follow it up with your charged sound wave or use it in combination with Flanger (E), which allows you to attack while moving.\nHer ultimate, Peacemaker(R), stops enemies from being able to fight for a moment. Use her ultimate after activating Delay(Q), charging your sound wave while enemies cannot fight. You can then attack them with a powerful sound wave, dealing damage while they are still dancing to the music.
CharacterGuide/9┃Isol excels at controlling the battlefield. The key to his playstyle is utilizing his MOK Operational Mines(R) to either expand your awareness and influence your enemies' movements or concentrate your area control into one lethal deathtrap.\n\nIsol's passive, Guerilla Warfare, enables impromptu placements of traps and reduces the defense of people that take damage from them, so expect your opponents to have detection and disarming drones. As time ticks down and the final zones approach, prepare yourself for a battle of resources and attrition.\n\nThere are two primary ways Isol goes on the offensive. Guerilla Warfare's defensive debuff applies to MOK Operational Mines, allowing Isol to tear through enemies if he focuses on his basic attacks. Alternatively, you can get items that lower your skill cooldowns increase the number of MOK Operational Mines you can have in a pile. Pairing a stack of MOK Mines with a movement-impairing trap makes for a cruel and effective ambush.\n\nAs destructive as Isol's MOK assault can be, he shines with his excellent awareness and evasion. Isol's mobility skill, Camouflage(E), cloaks him instantly so you can run and hide from your pursuers or cost them a camera. Use Sentex Bomb(Q) to scout bushes, lure enemies with a fake alert, or latch it onto an enemy for damage and crowd control. Following up Sentex Bomb with Rebel Assault(W) run-and-gun slow is an effective combo to chase or attack on the move, but try not to chase too hard! Isol is utilized best when he fights on his own battlefield.
CharacterGuide/10┃Li Dailin can use different strategies depending on how high her <color=yellow>BAC</color> is. \nDrink Up (W) temporarily boosts her basic attacks (Liquid Strength), while increasing her Blood Alcohol Content (BAC). If her BAC is above 40, Spirited Kick (Q), Bottom Shelf (E), Striking Tiger (R) reduce her BAC by a fixed amount, but she can deal a lot of damage when Tipsy is active. When consuming alcoholic drink items, she gets additional skill amplification and the duration of her Liquid Strength effect (increased basic attack damage) is extended. Consuming beverage items mid-fight is very effective.\nDrink Up (W) fills up your BAC, but be careful not to use it too often - Li Dailin cannot use her skills for a few seconds if she enters an Inebriated state. However, all her basic attacks are doubled while Inebriated state, so it might be useful when all your skills are in cooldown.
CharacterGuide/11┃Yuki deals additional damage and gains skill damage reduction depending on the number of cufflinks he has, which means that you should carefully manage his cufflinks. Yuki gains one cufflink automatically every 4 seconds, to a maximum of 4. You can also fill up your cufflinks with Button Up (W). Having a cufflink when using From Head to Toe (Q) stuns the enemy, increasing your chances to hit them with Dashing Gentleman (E) right after. On the other hand, if you use Dashing Gentleman (E) during the cooldown of From Head to Toe (Q), you can deal immediate damage with From Head to Toe (Q) right after dealing damage with Dashing Gentleman (E).\nWhen you max out the skill points of both Dashing Gentleman (E) and Button Up (W), you can use Dashing Gentleman (E) again immediately after using Button Up (W), making it possible to do a skill combo E-W-E.\nHis ultimate Coup de Grace (R) is effective for finishing off enemies or reducing the distance between you and them as it attacks in a wide range and has movement speed reduction effects.
CharacterGuide/12┃Hyejin can launch very powerful attacks quickly.\nYou can use Charm of Despair (Q) twice quickly, reducing your enemy's movement speed and allowing you to hit them with your other skills.\nCharm of the Prophecy (W) takes some time to activate, but it has a wide range, so it is good paired with the fear effect from Three Calamities (Passive), or when placed ahead in an area you don't have vision of.\nCharm of the Nomad (E) can be coupled with both charges of Cham of Despair (Q) to trigger the fear effect of Three Calamities (Passive), as a final blow, or as an escape that can teleport her over large sections of terrain.\nHer ultimate, Five Omens (R), not only deals damage after she focuses for a short time, but also allows for easy activation of her Three Calamities (Passive) thanks to the five omens that she summons around her.\nHyejin is able to control zones thanks to her strong skill combo, allowing her to ambush enemies and fear them without giving them time to respond.
CharacterGuide/13┃Collecting materials for not only equipment, but also for food and beverages, is very important for Xiukai because of his passive: Juggernaut Chef.\nWhen Xiukai makes food or drink, they have higher HP/SP, and will also increase his max HP (depending on rarity). While all of his skills cost HP, the more HP he has, the more damage he deals.\nXiukai's skills Heavy Meal (W), Wok It Off (E), and Burnt to a Crisp (R) apply extra damage and effects if the enemy has impaired movement, so it is important to combo those skills with Lost in the Sauce (Q).\nAfter using Lost in the Sauce (Q), try sliding to an enemy with Wok It Off (E) to knock them up. Use Heavy Meal (W) right after to slow them, and follow up with Burnt to a Crisp (R) to reduce their defense and deal a final blow. \nIf Xiukai continuously crafts food, he can have an extraordinarily high max HP level and easily take out his enemies to be the last survivor. 
CharacterGuide/14┃Chiara is a versatile character capable of both offensive and defensive playstyles. \n\nMania (E) throws out a tether that latches onto the first target it hits. Maintaining this tether restricts their movement. This allows you to stick to your enemies or escape from difficult situations.\n\nDepraved Prayer (W) gives a shield that temporarily increases Chiara's HP. Depraved Prayer may also be used right before a fight so that it may be reactivated to deal damage immediately.\n\nHand of Corruption (Q) can be used in a cone-shaped form or charged to shoot in a line. Try to utilize Hand of Corruption to slow an enemy, making it easier to hit Mania (E), or to get away from an enemy.\n\nStigma (Passive) reduces the defense of enemies for each stack applied. Every time that she hits an enemy with a skill, it applies a stack of Stigma, up to four. In conjunction with the skill damage applied from Plague (R), Chiara can reduce the defense of multiple enemies at once. At four stacks of Stigma, she also gains movement speed.\n\nPlague (R) causes Chiara's basic attacks to become temporarily ranged. Enemies inside of Plague's area of effect take skill damage every second, applying Stigma. In addition, when a player or animal has four stacks of Stigma on them, Chiara gains vision of them and may recast her R to end Plague and descend upon them dealing massive damage. A good usage of this is to close distance on a fleeing target. If the recast kills the target, the cooldown of Chiara's ultimate is reduced by 50%. \n\nChiara is at her strongest while using Plague. Enemies will run from her while she has it active! Be careful deciding when you want to use Plague, knowing when to go all-in is a skill best learned through experience. Now go and make the sinners of Lumia Island repent for their transgressions!\n\n
CharacterGuide/15┃Sissela specializes in dodging attacks and controlling enemies.\nAgony (Passive) will give her a good boost in battles. As her HP decreases, Sissela gains HP regeneration and extra skill damage.\nYou can put space between you and your enemies by sending out Wilson with Go Get 'Em, Wilson! (Q) to attack them for you.\nGirl in a Bubble (W) makes Sissela invulnerable. It also does some damage and pushes enemies back once it's over. \nYou can manipulate the battlefield thanks to Play With Us! (E). Not only can it be used to pull enemies, but can also be used to pull teammates or Sissela herself.\nHer ultimate, Free at Last (R), deals damage to players nearby and in the same area- including Sissela herself. Sissela can out damage enemies by avoiding attacks first with Girl in a Bubble (W) and increasing her stats with her passive before using her ultimate. \nCalculating when to use her skills is very important with Sissela. She becomes even more useful in teams.
CharacterGuide/16┃Silvia has different skills depending on if she's walking or on her motorcycle. She can ride her motorcycle once she reaches level 6 and has enough fuel. While not on the bike, she receives fuel passively, when she hits enemies, or moves to new zones. She cannot use basic attacks or weapon skills while riding her bike, but her movement speed increases. Driving in the same direction gradually increases her movement speed -- changing direction slows her down. Lumia Grand Prix (Passive) permanently increases her attack speed and skill amplification each time she enters a new zone. If she visits all 15 zones, she gains attack speed and skill amplification. \nWhen she's not on her bike, her skills revolve mainly around keeping her enemies at a distance by slowing them down or knocking them back. Radar Gun (Q) heals her allies and launching the Spare Tire (E) further away deals more damage. \nThe skills on her bike focus on getting close to her enemies. She can knock them airborne with Front Flip (W) or knock them back with Wheelie (E). \nSilvia can win in both up close and at a distance if she uses her skills right. She can get stronger by riding her motorcycle and travelling around Lumia when her fuel is full, allowing her to take the checkered flag.

You can also light on fire the oil slicks to create a burning area and deal damage over time.\nAs Adriana can charge in the targeted direction with Fire Escape (E), this skill is even more efficient when used with Oil Slick (W) to juke your enemies or chase them while also creating burning areas.\nAdriana can use Cocktail Party (R) up to 3 times to create burning areas and knock back enemies.\nShe excels at dealing continuous damage and easily controlling small areas like the last restricted area (safe zone).\nTake advantage of her long-ranged attacks and control the map to your advantage, and soon you'll be dominating the whole island with Adriana's fireworks.
CharacterGuide/18┃Use the short cooldowns of Shoichi's skills to expertly dodge enemy attacks and use his movement to deal with enemies.\nPhony Deal (Passive) increases Shoichi's critical strike chance as he hits enemies, and increases his basic attack damage when reaching 5 stacks. \nGood Faith (Q) is a unique skill. Hitting an enemy with it allows you to use Bad Faith, giving you increased range and a convenient dagger on the ground.\nBottom Line (W) is the main strength of Shoichi - his movement. Dash to an enemy or dagger and reset your Bottom Line cooldown if you pick up a dagger. \nWith Risky Business (E), Shoichi takes a step back and throws a dagger, leaving a dagger behind the enemy, making it a breeze to use Bottom Line (W) just after it.\nRuthless (R) deals AOE damage and leaves 4 daggers on the ground around him, making the terrain favorable to Shoichi.\nShoichi's skills can be connected easily thanks to his ability to leave daggers on the ground, and taking advantage of Phony Deal (Passive) will allow you to show your enemies the business. \nConnecting skills, precise control, and good judgement are keys to playing Shoichi efficiently.

CheerUP♥ (Passive) gives you a shield and empowers your next basic attack, making it a fantastic combo filler or even way to catch your opponents off guard. Change★ (R) is the most complex but enabling part of her kit, allowing Emma to confuse and displace her opponents by switching places with her Dove to root any test subject in the way. She can also switch with her Hat, pulling in all unfortunate enemies that happen to be on top of her, leaving them vulnerable to follow-up. Due to the nature of this skill being so flexible, there are many different combinations and combos for each situation. Utilize Emma's aggressive and defensive plays and use all the tricks up her sleeve to turn fights and make Lumia's residents nothing but her deceived audience!
CharacterGuide/20┃Lenox uses her whip to face enemies from any distance she pleases. With Recoil(Q), she can deal more damage to enemies that she puts space between. With Snakebite (W), she can damage enemies near her in a circle, slowing them, or attack enemies from afar, silencing them and increases her own movement speed. With Whiplash (E), she can push or pull enemies, allowing her to take full advantage of her Recoil (Q) and Snakebite (W).

Her Passive, Dual Wield, allows her to use her basic attack twice, plus she gets some tasty extra recovery when she eats or drinks things made out of chocolate. \nEasy Shot (Q) is her main skill.

She can use the skill again to push an enemy back, creating even more distance!\nRozzi can slow enemies by attaching her Semtex Bomb Mk-II (R) to them. If the bomb is attached, it's high time to attack her enemy and make it explode sooner.\nRozzi likes to stay at a distance, but because her skills have a short range, she has to get close and move quick to dodge attacks and secure kills. Her outplay potential is high and her flashy-ness is even higher; let's see what you can do.
CharacterGuide/22┃Luke gains skill effects based on his <color=yellow>Skill Evolution</color> so it opens up more ability customization!

Under the Knife allows Cathy to apply a stack of Wounded to enemies with skills. However, upon reaching 5 stacks, enemies are Severely Wounded and really start to feel the pain. Cathy deals additional critical strike damage to Severely Wounded enemies.\nPost-op: Hitting enemies with a skill grants her a shield, absorbing damage for a few seconds and increasing her movement speed.\nUse Double Bypass (Q) to dash in the targeted direction, dealing damage to enemies hit. She can also Wound enemies with her next basic attack after using a skill. If Cathy Severely Wounds an enemy, the cooldown of Double Bypass is reduced, opening up opportunity for her to pull off some sick combos. \nAmputation (W) has two "ranges": close range and the outer cone.

CharacterGuide/28┃Sua is a melee caster/brawler hybrid. Her passive, Bookworm, replaces her basic attack with a special, accelerated, skill damage version after using a skill. She can hold onto these special basic attacks, and using one reduces ALL of her ability cooldowns.\nSua can stop enemies from attacking her and to allow her to output her own damage instead. Odyssey (Q) is a long ranged ability that can be used to initiate fights. Hitting an enemy with any part of it places a Bookmark on them, and landing Odyssey on an enemy that has a Bookmark deals extra damage. The center strip of the ability stuns, which can be the perfect opportunity to follow up with Don Quixote (E). Bookmarked enemies take more damage from Don Quixote and are knocked airborne instead of being slowed. Don Quixote can also cover significant distance quickly, perfect for making a great escape.\nThe Curious Case (W) has two functions. When cast on an enemy, it blinds them, causing their auto attacks to miss. When cast on an ally or on yourself, it grants a shield, making you or your ally unstoppable, preventing a lot of CC! Well-timed usage of The Curious Case can make a world difference!\nSua's ultimate, Memory (R), recasts a stronger version of the spell she used. Memory of Odyssey is great for locking people down, Memory of Don Quixote can cover even greater distance to escape or run down enemies, and Memory of The Curious Case can prevent even more damage from enemies!\n...Now to find where I put my Lumia Library card... maybe she'll lend me some of Aesop's Fables\n
CharacterGuide/29┃Leon is ready to make quite the splash. \nLeon likes to fight in the water. Human Torpedo (Passive) causes his basic attacks to deal extra true damage and increases his movement and attack speed when he's on one of his pools. \nWaterway (Q) quickly shoots a straight trail of water that deals damage to enemies hit and creates him some of those pools he loves so much.\nCannonball (W) shields him (or a friend), and gives him some extra damage. Dealing damage with one of these extra strength attacks creates a pool near his enemy. Stand on that for some buffs or escape with his Duck Dive (E). He's slippery when wet. \nSpeaking of Duck Dive (E), Leon can use it to pop out of any pool of his choosing. When he pops out of it, he does damage and knocks up his enemies. He can use it to go over walls, too! He must've been practicing his butterfly stroke.\nWith Surf's Up (R), Leon rides a sick wave and gets pitted, sweeping away enemies in his path. Enemies are knocked back until the wave dissipates, and enemies that hit a wall are slowed and take damage. \nLeon doesn't want to get out of the pool, he's much stronger in them. He can create pools with both Waterway(Q) and Cannonball (W) to position himself strategically (or run) with Duck Dive(E). Combining all of these with Surf's Up (R) will surely make his opponents feel underwater.
CharacterGuide/30┃Eleven doubles as both a strong initiator and a fighter with incredible sustained damage potential.\nGround Beef (P) drops a slider on the ground after hitting consecutive autos. Eating it grants her some HP and the ability to activate any of her enhanced skills instantly.\nBurger Queen (Q) allows Eleven to deal damage and slow their enemies when it's enhanced. It is best used to continue chasing, as the slow will allow you to stick to your opponent for a longer period of time.\nFood For Thought (W) is an AOE CC ability that allows Eleven to both start and continue fights. It is best used after activating Calorie Cyclone to keep her opponents stuck inside of her raging food cyclone. Once they’re taunted, deal as much damage as possible!\nOn Air! (E) allows Eleven to run away - or to close the gap. It’s most potent when enhanced under the effects of a slider, as it lets her jump to any distance up to 12m without the need for any charge up! She can use this to catch opponents off guard and get on top of them, or to run away without the chance to stop her.\nCalorie Cyclone (R) will give Eleven an enhanced skill and greatly increase her damage. Once you are close to your opponent, pop this skill and start beating up your enemy with that massive fork of yours.\nAlso don't forget to cook up some #11 Combo Meals for you and your friends. They're delicious and really heal you!
CharacterGuide/31┃Rio’s got a couple bows in her arsenal that she can swap between, depending on what she's up against.\nHer passive, Hassetsu reduces her target’s defense based on her Critical Strike Chance. She can't deal critical strikes, but she still gets damaged based on her critical strike chance and skill amplification. She is a flexible and versatile archer with strengths regardless of the critical strike chance and skill amplification of her items. \nRio’s Kyudo Instinct(Q) allows her to swap bows. Her hankyu deals less damage but can attack quickly and continuously with 2 arrows. With her daikyu, she fires one single powerful arrow that is slower but deals more damage.\nShe also gets an extra effect applied to her next attack or skill after dealing damage to three targets with her skills or basic attacks. With her Hankyu, she gets increased movement and attack speed for a moment. Using her daikyu increases her damage dealt proportional to her enemy’s missing HP.

With her daikyu, she fires a single but powerful arrow that pierces targets, dealing damage, and reducing its cooldown.\nWith Soar(E), Rio jumps into the air and fires her arrows down towards her enemies. Soaring with her hankyu, she fires 2 arrows at enemies. With her daikyu, she can deal extra damage in an area. Damaging enemies also reduces its cooldown!\nLike the rest of her skills, Rio has a different ultimate ability with a bow. With her hankyu, Rio uses Fleeting Soul to fire multiple arrows in the direction. Each deals damage and lowers the cooldown of Fleeting Soul/Spirit Arrow. An extra one at the end knocks enemies back. If they're hit into a wall, they're stunned.\nWith her daikyu, Rio stabilizes herself and fires a Spirit Arrow in the targeted direction, dealing damage and slowing enemies. The further the arrow flies, the more damage it does!\n\n

He pegs his enemies with baseballs and can pick up balls that bounce off them to get an upper hand in battles.\n\nWith No Hitter(Passive), William's basic attacks cause a ball to bounce off enemies. When he walks towards one, his movement speed is increased and picking it up will cause his next basic attack to deal extra damage. No Hitter will stack up to 3, allowing him to use Fastball(Q) when fully stacked. 3 strikes and they're out, am I right?\n\nFastball(Q) gives him an attack speed boost and he'll throw an additional ball at enemies to deal extra damage.\n\nWindup(W) allows William to create a pitcher's mound around him that knocks enemies back, and pitches a baseball that returns to him, dealing damage and slowing enemies. Enemies that are hit by the ball both on the way out and on the way back are stunned. While standing on the mound, William's attack range is increased and No Hitter balls will return to him.\n\nSliding Catch(E) will let William slide to the targeted baseball. When he picks up a baseball, William's defense is increased for a short time.\n\nWith Signature Fireball(R), William leaps into the air and throws his signature fireball to the targeted area, dealing damage and slowing enemies. Four balls bounce out from the center after impact.\n\nWilliam can pick up the baseballs to increase his power or use sliding catch to keep his enemies on their toes. Make quick decisions with your baseballs - don't always give into the temptation to slide to one of them!\n\nWilliam's repertoire of pitches are what makes him the Ace Pitcher and will lead him to a perfect game!
CharacterGuide/33┃Nicky prefers to slam into enemies super fast and show off her close combat prowess. \n<color=#ffffff>Short Tempered (Passive)</color> is the core of Nicky's kit, which converts damage taken by other characters into <color=red>Rage</color>. When her rage meter is full, she becomes <color=yellow>Enraged</color> for a period of time, allowing her basic attacks and skills to deal extra damage to nearby enemies. Enraged ends when her rage meter is depleted, and she will not be able to refill her Rage for a short time.\nNicky can catch up to enemies quickly by using <color=#ffffff>Slugfest(Q)</color> and then fill up her Rage by using <color=#ffffff>Body Blow(Q2)</color>.\nShe can block enemy attacks with <color=#ffffff>Guard & Reverse(W)</color>. If she successfully blocks the attack, Nicky's rage meter will be fully charged. She reverses by rushing forward, dealing damage to enemies and rooting them.\nNicky can throw a <color=#ffffff>Knockout Punch(E)</color> in front of her, dealing damage and slowing enemies. While Enraged, Nicky can use <color=#ffffff>Fury Jab!!(Enhanced E)</color> instead, which deals enhanced damage and stuns enemies. They don't even share a cooldown!\nFinally, <color=#ffffff>Pure Rage Uppercut!!(R)</color> is Nicky's powerful ultimate that can be only used when Nicky is Enraged. She dashes to the targeted enemy player and uppercuts them, dealing massive damage and knocking them airborne. Enraged immediately ends and Nicky lands slightly before the enemy, which gives her some time to follow up with additional offense. \nNicky's main strategy is to take advantage of Short Tempered by balancing her rage meter between basic attacks and skills. 
CharacterGuide/34┃Nathapon uses his strong crowd control to keep enemies in his consistent damage.\nSlow Shutter(Passive) has two effects. First, his camera’s attack speed is fixed but his basic attacks deal extra skill damage. Second, he can create an invisible Trail Camera with a Branch and a Surveillance Camera.\nSnapshot(Q) has both a passive and an active effect. \nSnapshot's passive enables Nathapon to apply Picturesque to enemies when dealing damage. Picturesque can be stacked up to 3 times, with each stack increasing Nathapon's damage. Enemies lose all stacks of Picturesque when they leave Nathapon's vision range.\nSnapshot(Active) lets Nathapon snap a photograph of the targeted area, dealing damage. Enemies with max stacks of Picturesque are slowed.\nTimelapse(W) deals damage over time and slows enemies in range. The final frame of the timelapse deals extra damage and roots enemies.\nPanorama(E) lets Nathapon take a photo with his telephoto lens in the targeted direction. Although this skill is precise, catching the enemy successfully will leave a mark in an area. After a moment, the captured enemy will be knocked back towards the mark.\nNathapon's ultimate, F-Stop(R), lets him snap a photo of everything in the targeted area. All photographed enemies are put into stasis, unable to perform any action, and gain 3 stacks of Picturesque.\nThe key to outplaying your opponents with Nathapon is vision range and accurate timing. Be careful of blind spots that the enemy can disappear into!
CharacterGuide/35┃Jan is a kickboxer with diverse combos at his disposal! Use his cooldown reduction mechanic properly and you'll knock out your enemies in no time at all.\nJan's passive, <color=#ffffff>Unyielding(P)</color>, is crucial for triggering skill combos. Jan gains a stack of <color=#ffffff>Unyielding(P)</color> each time he deals damage. When he has stacks of <color=#ffffff>Unyielding(P)</color>, his next basic skill consumes stacks, enhancing it, and reducing its cooldown.\n<color=#ffffff>Knee Strike(Q)</color> deals damage to enemies and slows them. Reactivating will cast <color=#ffffff>Leaping Knee(Q)</color>, dealing damage to enemies, knocking them airborne, and allowing additional attacks. Enhanced <color=#ffffff>Knee Strike(Q)</color> reduces the enemy's defense and enhanced <color=#ffffff>Leaping Knee(Q)</color> resets the cooldown of <color=#ffffff>Bob and Weave(E)</color>.\nJan can use <color=#ffffff>Tomahawk Roundhouse(W)</color> to sweep the area in front of him with a kick, dealing damage to enemies in range. Enemies hit in the outer cone will be knocked back. Enhanced <color=#ffffff>Tomahawk Roundhouse(W)</color> deals more damage and knocks back all enemies in range. Enemies knocked into terrain are stunned.\nJan dashes forward with <color=#ffffff>Bob and Weave(E)</color> and his next basic attack will deal extra basic attack damage. Hitting <color=#ffffff>Knee Strike(Q)</color> or <color=#ffffff>Tomahawk Roundhouse(W)</color> after dashing heals him for a percentage of damage dealt, increasing based on his missing HP. Jan can use <color=#ffffff>Bob and Weave(E)</color> while using <color=#ffffff>Tomahawk Roundhouse(W)</color>.\nJan's ultimate, <color=#ffffff>The Tetragon(R)</color>, summons a boxing ring. Enemies that touch the ropes are slowed and take damage. Enemies that are knocked back into the ropes will bounce towards the center of the ring, stunning them. Killing a player inside the ring grants a stack of Unyielding and increases Jan's movement speed.\nJan's skills may be short range, but his explosive strength is highlighted in close combat. Try to keep your enemies close as you execute your super quick combos!
CharacterGuide/36┃Eva is ready to unleash powerful, long-range VF barrages onto her enemies!\n<color=#ffffff>Telekinesis(Passive) </color> launches a bead to her enemy’s location when she is attacked or lands a skill. Starting level 6, Eva can also perform all interactions with objects from a distance excluding hyperloops, revive terminals, or other machines.\n<color=#ffffff>Light Triad(Q) </color> casts an orb of light, dealing damage and exploding when recasted or at maximum range. \n<color=#ffffff>Phase Vortex(W) </color> forms a Phase Vortex in the targeted location, dealing damage. Enemies inside the vortex take extra damage from Eva’s skills and are slowed. When the vortex collapses, it will deal damage and launch enemies in the center airborne.\n<color=#ffffff>Amethyst Flow(E) </color> makes Eva unstoppable when dashing to the targeted direction. After dashing, she is granted vision of all enemies near her for a few seconds and her next basic attack is enhanced. If Eva lands a basic attack on a target that is affected by one of her crowd control effects, it applies Amethyst Duress, dealing extra damage over time and granting Eva vision of them.\n<color=#ffffff>VF Eruption(R) </color> releases Eva’s stored VF, dealing true damage continuously. A stack of VF Dissonance is applied each tick and deals additional damage at max stacks. \nVision control is crucial for Eva to get the high ground against her opponents. Make sure she doesn't get ambushed!
CharacterGuide/37┃Daniel is an assassin who roams in the dark and quickly finishes wounded foes.\nDaniel’s passive <color=#ffffff>Recluse(P)</color>, lets him thrive in the darkness of the night. His vision penalty is reduced and his out of combat movement speed is increased. Also, his attack power increases as he loses HP regardless of the time of day.\nDaniel uses <color=#ffffff>Dusk Shears(Q)</color> to manifest ghastly scissors at the targeted location, dealing damage, slows enemies hit, and increases the attack speed of his next 3 basic attacks. Hitting an enemy with the middle of the blades deals extra damage and reduces the cooldown of <color=#ffffff>Dusk Shears(Q)</color> and <color=#ffffff>Shadow Glide(E)</color>.\nDaniel marks his target with <color=#ffffff>Growing Inspiration</color>, granting him 2m of vision around his target, and slowing himself for a few seconds. The <color=#ffffff>Growing Inspiration</color> mark reduces the target's vision range until damaged by Daniel and stores some of Daniel's damage dealt to the target. After a few seconds, Daniel becomes <color=#ffffff>Inspired</color> by his target, revealing them to Daniel. Daniel stays <color=#ffffff>Inspired</color> by the target for a few seconds. Damaging the <color=#ffffff>Inspired</color> target consumes the mark, dealing the stored damage along with additional damage, and roots the target. Killing an enemy with the damage from the <color=#ffffff>Inspiration</color> mark resets its cooldown. Daniel becomes uninspired if the target moves too far away from him.\nDaniel uses his <color=#ffffff>Shadow Glide(E)</color> to duck into the shadows and dash in the targeted direction. His next basic attack teleports him behind his target, dealing additional damage.\n<color=#ffffff>Masterpiece(R)</color> lets Daniel become his target’s shadow if they have <color=#ffffff>Growing Inspiration</color>, if he is <color=#ffffff>Inspired</color> by them, or if they are <color=#ffffff>Rooted</color>. While Daniel is shadowing his target, he repeatedly deals cellular damage. Upon reaching the max duration or reactivating the skill, Daniel completes his masterpiece and leaves them behind, dealing damage based on his target’s missing HP.\nDaniel needs to time his assassination attempts well to be as deadly as possible. His damage output potential is high, but be careful not to commit too early - it might cause you to lose your own head!
CharacterGuide/38┃Jenny swaps between her 2 roles: Red Wine is the top star that she always dreamed she would be, and Black Tea is her true self. Jenny gains Rehearsal when using basic attacks or landing Spotlight (Q). She also gains special effects through Rehearsal as well!\nPay attention to <color=#ffffff>Persona (E)</color>, which lets Jenny swap between her mobility-focused Black Tea role and combat-focused Red Wine role. She also performs a forward dash. Basic attacks reduce the cooldown of Persona (E), and deals extra skill damage for every 4th basic attack.\n<color=#ffffff>Play Dead(P)</color> gives Jenny a second wind. If Jenny’s health is depleted when she has enough Rehearsal, she hides herself in the shadows and reappears, dealing damage to enemies around her.\n<color=#ffffff>Spotlight (Q)</color> shines on the targeted location with spotlights, and Jenny receives buffs if she is under it.\n<color=#ffffff>Red Carpet(W)</color> rolls out a red carpet, pushing or pulling her enemies based on her current role.\n<color=#ffffff>Acceptance Speech (R)</color> creates an award stage slowing enemies that step on it. When it disappears, it deals damage and charms enemies.\nJenny’s area control and high mobility makes up for her short range, plus her ability to Play Dead allows her to take risky opportunities where other characters wouldn't be able to survive!

Tutorial/Desc/1┃Welcome to Lumia Island.\n\nJackie will teach you the basics of item searching in order to survive on this island.\n\nTo think you'll learn from a Serial Killer! You're in good hands, right?
Tutorial/Desc/2┃Learn about skills and fighting with the Axe weapon. The axe is good to learn with because it's stronger than other weapons in the beginning of the match.\n\nFind enemies and kill them. The axe will become weaker as the game progresses.
Tutorial/Desc/3┃You can become stronger by killing wild animals.\n\nYou'll play as Aya. She might seem careless, but she's still a police officer handling a gun.
Tutorial/Desc/4┃Try exploring Lumia Island a bit more.\n\nJackie is an intelligent murderer. Try efficiently finding materials so you can craft several targeted items at the same time.
Tutorial/Desc/5┃Your weapon and defense masteries increase as you fight.\n\nMoving around increases your movement mastery and making equipment increases your crafting mastery.\n\nAya might seem like a weak rookie with a puny sniper rifle,\nbut you'll change your mind once she lands a shot on you after increasing her sniper rifle mastery.

로딩팁 튜토리얼56┃Leon has excellent observation skills.\nHe keeps his head on a swivel at all times.
로딩팁 튜토리얼57┃He doesn't want anyone to know, but Leon spends his days off watching TV and eating ice cream straight out of the tub.
로딩팁 튜토리얼58┃Magnus sincerely looks down on cowards.\nThat's likely the source of his admiration towards Fiora, who he sees is always calling for a fair fight.
로딩팁 튜토리얼59┃Magnus is always on his bike.\nEven when he's running away, it's at full speed on his bike.
로딩팁 튜토리얼60┃Strategy is useless to Silvia. She likes to take risks just for fun.\nIt isn't always quite as fun for her teammates...
로딩팁 튜토리얼61┃There's not one athlete who's needed their bike repaired more than Silvia.
로딩팁 튜토리얼62┃If you stumble upon Li Dailin and Mai together, it's in your best interest to avoid them.\nNo, they won't attack you, but you'll be subject to their drunken ramblings.
로딩팁 튜토리얼63┃When she made the decision to sell her family's studio, Li Dailin was decidedly not under the influence of alcohol.
로딩팁 튜토리얼64┃If she's seemingly talking without taking a breath, raising her voice, or locks eyes with you...\nrun away from Chiara.
로딩팁 튜토리얼65┃Emma once gifted Chiara a pair of shoes! Hopefully they were the right size.
로딩팁 튜토리얼66┃Hart always experiences an internal dilemma when she hears to Jackie humming.\nShe loves her voice and wants to request a song, but fears her untimely death if she does so.
로딩팁 튜토리얼67┃Hart isn't just good at music, she also a god at rhythm games.\nShe (awkwardly) autographed a couple of things for people at her local arcade once.
로딩팁 튜토리얼68┃Camilo was very close to his sister.\nHe started growing his hair out after she passed away.
로딩팁 튜토리얼69┃Camilo tries to solve all his problems by dancing.\nHe may have resolved a conflict or two because of it, but it certainly doesn't have a 100% success rate.
로딩팁 튜토리얼70┃He claims that ever since he became a hunter, Bernice hasn't slept in a bed.
로딩팁 튜토리얼71┃While the humans of Lumia hunt each other, Bernice had previously hunted a human outside of Lumia.
로딩팁 튜토리얼72┃Adela tends to avoid the unpredictable.\nLike roulette and... Alex.
로딩팁 튜토리얼73┃Even if her opponent is a total rookie or child, Adela always plays to win.
로딩팁 튜토리얼74┃Adriana calls for her late little sister, Lily.\nAdriana blames herself for not being able to protect her.

로딩팁 튜토리얼76┃Nathapon holds on to his camera and a notepad to jot everything down in case he gets amnesia again.
로딩팁 튜토리얼77┃Nathapon only trusts his records and photos, but what if someone modifies them?\nWhat if that someone is Nathapon himself?
로딩팁 튜토리얼78┃Even after his arrival to Lumia, Yuki still maintains his self care routine.\nHe's always making sure his outfit is perfect.
로딩팁 튜토리얼79┃Rio doesn't like Yuki. Yuki doesn't know why...
로딩팁 튜토리얼80┃Lenox isn't her real name, but she's never told us what it is.
로딩팁 튜토리얼81┃Lenox once defended Hyejin.\nIt was reminiscent of when she protected her boss's daughter in the past.
로딩팁 튜토리얼82┃Sua's dream is to have her very own private library.
로딩팁 튜토리얼83┃The first time Sua meets someone, she always asks what books they like.\nShe recommends a lot of books. So many books. Please stop recommending so many books, Sua.
로딩팁 튜토리얼84┃Mai doesn't mince her words.\nShe said she wanted Camilo as a model, but second guessed herself after hearing how noisy he was.
로딩팁 튜토리얼85┃Mai never stops sewing, even after she came to the island.
로딩팁 튜토리얼86┃If you ever spot Jan at a club or a party, ask what he's drinking.\n(It'll be a protein shake 100% of the time)
로딩팁 튜토리얼87┃Although he's usually cheerful and bold, but something inside Jan changes when he fights.
로딩팁 튜토리얼88┃Luke says he can clean the entirety of island in three hours.\n...Place your bets!
로딩팁 튜토리얼89┃Luke spent some of his youth in an orphanage.\nHe doesn't really like to talk about that.
로딩팁 튜토리얼90┃Rozzi really likes chocolate.\nAs soon as she opens her eyes in the morning, she looks for some.
로딩팁 튜토리얼91┃Isol doesn't recognize the now 20 year old Rozzi.
로딩팁 튜토리얼92┃Emma went to a rather prestigious boarding school. If she hadn't decided to pursue magic, she might've become an accountant!
로딩팁 튜토리얼93┃Emma left home and worked days as a barista and evenings as a magician.\nShe claims she slept for only 3 hours a day. Where does she get all that energy?
로딩팁 튜토리얼94┃Eleven carries a rabbit doll with her.\nIt's a gift made by her one and only true friend.
로딩팁 튜토리얼95┃Eleven's mother's wealth may be higher than we can imagine.
로딩팁 튜토리얼96┃Daniel's been seen drawing alongside of Sissela.\nIf he'd have become the artist he originally dreamed of, he might've become an... ordinary person.
로딩팁 튜토리얼97┃Daniel's pretty good at guessing a person's job just by looking at their hair condition.
로딩팁 튜토리얼98┃Rio likes cats but she loves the big fat chonker cats.
로딩팁 튜토리얼99┃Rio is so shy that it's hard for her to approach strangers.\nShe does like people though! Just talk to her first!
로딩팁 튜토리얼100┃Eva can knit really quickly.\nLet her make you a scarf, glove, or sweater! Mai's jealous.
로딩팁 튜토리얼101┃Eva's never needed a flashlight.\nShe uses her own eyes to light her path.
로딩팁 튜토리얼102┃Watch your sodium intake if you're ever eating something that Nicky made!\nShe loves salt so much that she'd even drink ramen soup as water.
로딩팁 튜토리얼103┃Nicky worked as a regular actress before transitioning to a stunt one.
로딩팁 튜토리얼104┃Echion likes coffee. Surprising, right? It just seems like he doesn't really enjoy the taste of it.
로딩팁 튜토리얼105┃Echion has no recollection of his past.\nOnly a few researchers in the Spartoi project actually know his true past.
로딩팁 튜토리얼106┃Disarming Bianca is a simple two step procedure.\nStep one: take away her parasol. Step two: run!
로딩팁 튜토리얼107┃Bianca once roamed Lumia Island with Chloe's doll.\nShe changed the doll's name from Nina to Marie.
로딩팁 튜토리얼108┃Chloe based Nina on a younger version of herself.
로딩팁 튜토리얼109┃Chloe isn't really the athletic type.\nIf it weren't for Nina, she would've probably already... well... you know.
로딩팁 튜토리얼110┃Johann developed a love for wine largely due to his mentor.
로딩팁 튜토리얼111┃Johann once seriously considered becoming a soldier.
로딩팁 튜토리얼112┃If you ever get Celine in a secret santa, she's easy.\nJust give her anything that explodes.
로딩팁 튜토리얼113┃Celine dreams of trying combat rations from every nation.
로딩팁 튜토리얼114┃Aiden was failed to be captured in the past.\n A few years later, he decided to participate in the experiment of his on volition for some reason.
로딩팁 튜토리얼115┃Be mindful of static electricity if you are with Aiden.\nJust in case.
로딩팁 튜토리얼116┃Barbara once screamed in terror when she saw one of Daniel's "masterpieces".
로딩팁 튜토리얼117┃Bianca once recoiled in pain when Johann jokingly sprayed her with water.\nShe must've thought it was real holy water...
로딩팁 튜토리얼118┃Hyunwoo and Jackie once fought one-on-one. Jackie won pretty handily...\nYou know that old saying: don't bring your fists to a chainsaw murder fight.
로딩팁 튜토리얼119┃Yuki once held a concert with a few other on Lumia Island.\nHyunwoo sincerely felt sorry for Yuki then.
로딩팁 튜토리얼120┃The researchers are working as hard as always.
로딩팁 튜토리얼121┃Vital Force (VF) is all around us. Only a select few can manipulate it.
로딩팁 튜토리얼122┃The current experiment is the second experiment.
로딩팁 튜토리얼123┃If there's an item that you need, Alt-Click the item to let your team know what you're looking for.
로딩팁 튜토리얼124┃Watch out if the CCTVs are glowing red! Someone may be watching you. Creepy.
로딩팁 튜토리얼125┃Even if you get killed in a Duo or Squad game, Rapid Reconstruction will let you revive and head right back into battle!\nBut be careful, Rapid Reconstruction is only available until Night 2!
