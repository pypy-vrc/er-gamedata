Skin/OnSelectVO/1002002┃Look, the fireworks are starting!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1007005┃Alright, let's have some fun.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1008002┃Love and peace... even in the winter!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1014002┃The time has come to guide these lost souls.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1015004┃Would sweets help me forget the pain?
Skin/OnSelectVO/1016003┃Guaranteed to be on time or get your money back!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1023002┃Let's quarantine the virus before it gets out of control.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1024002┃Time to head for a new dream.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1028003┃Maybe it's time to put the book down and go on a little adventure myself.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1033002┃I'll beat this heat right outta the air!!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1037001┃Perhaps death is the real cure.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1042002┃It is an honor to serve me!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1050003┃Do I have to?
Skin/OnSelectVO/1019004┃Did you miss me? The summer special show is about to begin!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1058002┃My long-awaited vacation, gotta enjoy it!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1018004┃Wise choice. 
Skin/OnSelectVO/1003004┃I'm at your disposal. Chore list updated.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1021003┃Maid Rozzi, ready for action.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1048003┃Do you like...pixel art?
Skin/OnSelectVO/1069001┃Ta-da! The Leni's Marching Band is on the move!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1017004┃Come here... Complete me
Skin/OnSelectVO/1055003┃"I'm..I'm curious... what's their blood taste like?"...haha
Skin/OnSelectVO/1011005┃I will bring salvation to all lost souls.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1036004┃What memories can we make today?
Skin/OnSelectVO/1010005┃Ready for a summer adventure?
Skin/OnSelectVO/1065002┃<color=#00FFFF>Let's go somewhere cool!</color> \n<color=#F78181>Hope it's not too cold.</color>
Skin/OnSelectVO/1067002┃Are you ready for this bunny?
Skin/OnSelectVO/1031006┃My arrows never miss... pow!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1030004┃We are live! Get ready with me for my wedding!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1073002┃Join me for the ultimate game at the end of the world!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1020005┃Is it my turn? Already?
Skin/OnSelectVO/1064003┃Let's fly away together into a new world!
Skin/OnSelectVO/1045004┃Let's go on to the next stage! 
Skin/OnSelectVO/1047004┃Where are you? I heard you needed my help.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1072002┃Attention, everyone. I’m here.
Skin/OnSelectVO/1022006┃Let's take out the trash.
Skin/Desc/1001001┃If you hear her humming, maybe run the other direction.
Skin/Desc/1001002┃A rose by any other name would also have thorns.
Skin/Desc/1001003┃There are people who make rules... and people who break them.
Skin/Desc/1002001┃She's been on patrol for five hours.\nI think shes... lost?
Skin/Desc/1003001┃Her eyes sparkled like the glint of her blade.\nOne must always fight to preserve their honor. 
Skin/Desc/1003002┃All for one, and one for all.
Skin/Desc/1004001┃Kiss the ring to show your respect.
Skin/Desc/1004002┃How do I look? It takes a real man to rock flowers.
Skin/Desc/1005001┃The glint will be the last thing you see before the darkness.
Skin/Desc/1005002┃It's time for my experiment.
Skin/Desc/1006001┃Focus and aim. Don't make them suffer.
Skin/Desc/1006002┃My my, what big teeth you have!
Skin/Desc/1006003┃Only the strongest wolf can lead its pack.
Skin/Desc/1007001┃Sometimes, the only way to end an argument is to use your fists.
Skin/Desc/1007002┃It's hot down here. Must be in the right place.
Skin/Desc/1007003┃You want to fight? Heh, I guess I can spare a couple minutes.
Skin/Desc/1007004┃I can do even better than this.
Skin/Desc/1008001┃Today's performance is gonna be incredible! Heh, it might even change the world.
Skin/Desc/1008002┃Let's.. let's start the show.
Skin/Desc/1009001┃It's the end of the world. Better be prepared.
Skin/Desc/1009002┃Demons are demons. Their pasts are... irrelevant.
Skin/Desc/1010001┃The nomad life ain't so bad. I have nowhere to go and nobody looking for me.
Skin/Desc/1010002┃This? It's.. uh... just water.
Skin/Desc/1010003┃Don't worry, Dragon Dailin is here to ward off all those pesky evil spirits following you around!
Skin/Desc/1011001┃A model student who treats every training exercise as if it were the real thing.
Skin/Desc/1011002┃As gentle as a breeze or as strong as a raging tempest.
Skin/Desc/1011003┃It seems like a whole new world awaits us.
Skin/Desc/1012001┃Their destinies are just like magnolias - blooming white but slowly and surely fading darker.
Skin/Desc/1012002┃I've always been destined for greatness. 
Skin/Desc/1012003┃It is my destiny to bring the wandering souls to peace.
Skin/Desc/1013001┃Sushi isn't easy to make, but the time it takes to cook a fish is nothing compared to the time that fish spent living and... dreaming?
Skin/Desc/1013002┃If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a flaming volleyball with a drawing of a dumpling on it. 
Skin/Desc/1014001┃Sinners, prepare to face your judgement. 
Skin/Desc/1014002┃Guidance to the lost. Salvation to the damned.
Skin/Desc/1015001┃Holding onto life like a clover holding onto the ground in the frost. 
Skin/Desc/1015002┃I...tried something a little different today. Wilson too.
Skin/Desc/1015003┃Do you like snow? I.. I guess I don't hate it...
Skin/Desc/1016001┃How'd you like to feel the midnight breeze flow through your hair?
Skin/Desc/1016002┃Your Games. Your Devices. Play Anywhere.
Skin/Desc/1017001┃Where should I start the first fire?\nEh, doesn't matter. It'll all just burn anyway!
Skin/Desc/1017002┃Kill it with fire!
Skin/Desc/1018001┃I really don't care who you're trying to silence.\nI only care that the check clears.
Skin/Desc/1018002┃I love a good carnival. Nobody expects any danger during a celebration. 
Skin/Desc/1019001┃Today's entree will be delicious, sir!
Skin/Desc/1019002┃Trick or Treat! I worked super hard on my costume this year!
Skin/Desc/1020001┃Settle down now, little ones. I wouldn't want to raise my voice.
Skin/Desc/1020002┃I hope they don't mind if I crash their party, but I'm in the mood for some fun.
Skin/Desc/1020004┃Don't get too close - or you'll never escape.
Skin/Desc/1021001┃Target confirmed. Proceeding with mission.
Skin/Desc/1021002┃Looks may deceive... but bullets won't.
Skin/Desc/1022001┃Order something shaken, not stirred.
Skin/Desc/1022002┃My bad! I just gotta clean up ALL the garbage...
Skin/Desc/1023001┃After the war is over, can you really call one side victorious?
Skin/Desc/1023002┃C'mon, it won't hurt. I just need to tweak you a little more.
Skin/Desc/1024001┃Always make the first move towards victory.
Skin/Desc/1025001┃Don't overthink. Keep your head down. Survive.
Skin/Desc/1026001┃I can get more horsepower out of anything. Even a toaster!!
Skin/Desc/1027001┃Mission complete. On to the next one.
Skin/Desc/1028001┃I hope class ends soon. I gotta go to the library.
Skin/Desc/1028002┃Remember, every new year is the first page of your new story.
Skin/Desc/1029001┃Time to put all that swimming to good use.
Skin/Desc/1030001┃Today's stream will be particularly sweet!
Skin/Desc/1031001┃My arrow will cleanse the unholy.
Skin/Desc/1031002┃May justice guide my arrow!
Skin/Desc/1031003┃My arrow will expel the darkness!
Skin/Desc/1032001┃It's been a while since I've been this cold. Well, happy holidays I suppose.
Skin/Desc/1033001┃You really came here without a plan? Heh, bold.
Skin/Desc/1034001┃I'll try my best to capture all of this perfect scenery through the lens of my camera.
Skin/Desc/1035001┃A good fight always starts with the right mindset. Remember that.
Skin/Desc/1036001┃The stars once acted as a celestial compass to guide those who were lost.\nI hope I can be someone like that to you.
Skin/Desc/1037001┃What a mess. Time to patch things up.
Skin/Desc/1038001┃You didn't see anything. It'd be wise for you to remember that.
Skin/Desc/1039001┃Much like the impossible blue rose, I took a white orchid and turned it blue. 
Skin/Desc/1040001┃We'll take good care of you.
Skin/Desc/1044001┃Don't bother begging. Your life's already over.
Skin/Desc/1041001┃The holy flame brings light to darkness.
Skin/Desc/1042001┃Who dares wake me up from my slumber?
Skin/Desc/1043001┃There's no bomb I can't defuse.
Skin/Desc/1045001┃So, where's my seat?
Skin/Desc/1046001┃I feel bad, but... Your story ends here. 
Skin/Desc/1047001┃Time to leave. Ta ta for now~
Skin/Desc/1036002┃If this will let someone else have a normal life, then it's worth it.
Skin/Desc/1028003┃I wonder what kind of story the ocean will tell me today.
Skin/Desc/1029002┃I feel fully in my element here.
Skin/Desc/1031004┃You're blocking the sun. Could you move?
Skin/Desc/1033002┃Just go all out? C'mon, at least give me a script!
Skin/Desc/1048001┃With my brush in hand, the world is my canvas!
Skin/Desc/1049001┃Ticket looks good! Have a wonderful time at Lumialand!
Skin/Desc/1051001┃May this melody never wither.
Skin/Desc/1052001┃I can show you the way, but only you can choose your path.
Skin/Desc/1050001┃I only dance for myself.
Skin/Desc/1054001┃Listen up, stupid: don't you dare underestimate the ocean.
Skin/Desc/1053001┃The weak die off. The strong live on.
Skin/Desc/1055001┃This is my turf. I'm going in!
Skin/Desc/1056001┃The only things you can never have too much of are practice... and money.
Skin/Desc/1002002┃Can we do this again next year? Together?
Skin/Desc/1022003┃We have to clean ALL of this? Well, we better get started.
Skin/Desc/1016003┃Thanks for waiting, here's your order!
Skin/Desc/1018003┃Call me for the best service in town.
Skin/Desc/1030002┃You better not be late! Or you won't get dessert.
Skin/Desc/1057001┃Let's keep our eyes on the compass.
Skin/Desc/1026002┃There's nowhere I can't reach. I have no limits.
Skin/Desc/1025002┃There are things that can't be fixed with prayers..
Skin/Desc/1043002┃Which do you prefer: a tangy flavor, or the kind that bursts in your mouth?
Skin/Desc/1058001┃Even the worst enemies can become potential partners.
Skin/Desc/1019003┃Are you ready for the show?
Skin/Desc/1003003┃A sword is just like wine: cold and smooth. 
Skin/Desc/1008003┃All I need are my guitar and my amp, and it's showtime!
Skin/Desc/1012004┃Effort is more important than fate.
Skin/Desc/1037002┃I'll show you who I really am behind this mask.
Skin/Desc/1038002┃An actor's strength isn't their good looks, but their unyielding confidence.
Skin/Desc/1060001┃Art is finding beauty where there's only destruction.
Skin/Desc/1059001┃I'll have your back! ...If you have mine. 
Skin/Desc/1045002┃Clothes can be like wings. Now's the perfect time to prove it!
Skin/Desc/1024002┃I am the owner of my dreams, the master of my fate.
Skin/Desc/1050002┃Make sure to come on time. I will wait for no one.
Skin/Desc/1061001┃I know I'm cute but don't underestimate me! 
Skin/Desc/1010004┃Give me some snacks or I'll eat you!
Skin/Desc/1011004┃You can tell who's evil by how much they smell.
Skin/Desc/1007005┃If you don't want to get hit, stay the hell outta my way.
Skin/Desc/1009003┃It's a good night for a fresh start.
Skin/Desc/1040002┃Thanks for sticking with me for another year.\n<color=#10adff>That's what Nina should say!</color>
Skin/Desc/1036003┃Are you ready for your present?
Skin/Desc/1013003┃I'm ready for my mascot debut!
Skin/Desc/1047002┃The more things you have, the more you have to lose.
Skin/Desc/1027002┃Puzzles and cases have one thing in common: they both want to be solved.
Skin/Desc/1015004┃Please don't touch my display items... Wilson's watching.
Skin/Desc/1062001┃It's up to us to finish the job.
Skin/Desc/1049002┃Play smart. Win more. OP.GG
Skin/Desc/1032002┃Let me teach you how to survive in this place.
Skin/Desc/1063001┃Is that the best plan you've got?
Skin/Desc/1033003┃Beat it! I don't have time to waste on you!
Skin/Desc/1041002┃The flame of purification will wash you away.
Skin/Desc/1050003┃Let me remind you what your duty as a student is.
Skin/Desc/1048002┃I wonder what power the colors of my magic hold.
Skin/Desc/1004003┃You call yourself a rebel? Pathetic!
Skin/Desc/1044002┃Show me what you're made of.
Skin/Desc/1042002┃Fortunately, you're on time. I guess you deserve a compliment.
Skin/Desc/1039002┃Being loved is the most beautiful thing in the world!
Skin/Desc/1064001┃Not all dreams are happy.
Skin/Desc/1035002┃Determination isn't enough. You need to be ready for anything.
Skin/Desc/1055002┃Ready to stop, drop, and roll?
Skin/Desc/1031005┃My arrow will illuminate the way.
Skin/Desc/1034002┃How am I supposed to choose one photo to showcase my travels...
Skin/Desc/1017003┃Master, if you're cold, I can turn up the heat... hehe...
Skin/Desc/1046002┃If you're in hot water, I'm your guy.
Skin/Desc/1020003┃Let's see what is hiding in those treasure chests!
Skin/Desc/1051002┃I just thought of the perfect lyrics! I need to write them down!
Skin/Desc/1019004┃I'll show you a magic trick to beat the heat!
Skin/Desc/1029004┃Our voyage begins now.
Skin/Desc/1001004┃Are you ready to have some fun?
Skin/Desc/1058002┃Hard work pays off.
Skin/Desc/1045003┃Can you play a little further away so I don't get splashed?
Skin/Desc/1022004┃Double L never closes. Even in summer!
Skin/Desc/1052002┃Will you accept my fate?
Skin/Desc/1049003┃Hey, you look suspicious! Let's do a quick inspection.
Skin/Desc/1014003┃I don't want to go to a coven of witches...
Skin/Desc/1028004┃Want to hear a story with your cup of coffee?
Skin/Desc/1053002┃Mercy? Do you know who I am?
Skin/Desc/1054002┃Survival of the fittest! 
Skin/Desc/1030003┃Summer getaway with Eleven! Live now!
Skin/Desc/1065001┃<color=#cb2849>Headquarters, all clear now.</color> \n<color=#10adff>Oh! A very suspicious guy is coming this way!</color>
Skin/Desc/1047003┃The bitter end makes the chocolate taste sweeter.
Skin/Desc/1018004┃It's going to be a long night.
Skin/Desc/1023003┃Failing students need extra classes.
Skin/Desc/1003004┃Entering the field. The first priority is to ensure the safety of the client!
Skin/Desc/1066001┃History is about to be rewritten once again.
Skin/Desc/1042003┃Were you really looking forward to meet me? Hehe, what a compliment! 
Skin/Desc/1021003┃I've prepared a full course meal for you. Hope you like the main dish. 
Skin/Desc/1002003┃I will not let you get in the way of our business!
Skin/Desc/1025003┃All members of the unit, prepare a welcome party for our uninvited guests.
Skin/Desc/1056002┃It looks like you need to clear your mind a bit.
Skin/Desc/1016004┃So, where do we go next?
Skin/Desc/1067001┃A bad deed always brings a punishment. 
Skin/Desc/1048003┃Don't you love seeing pixel art transitions?
Skin/Desc/1068001┃There's no such thing as being too old for romance.
Skin/Desc/1012005┃I'm not used to this, but... do I match the vibe?
Skin/Desc/1022005┃Ready for your gifts?
Skin/Desc/1062002┃Fight and protect. Simple as that.
Skin/Desc/1043003┃To a faraway place, where no one will ever find me.
Skin/Desc/1059002┃Nothing personal. Just here for that reward on your head.
Skin/Desc/1069001┃Alright everyone, focus! The Leni's Marching Band performance is about to begin!
Skin/Desc/1060002┃The anticipation for the day to come is as full of joy as the day itself.
Skin/Desc/1009004┃It wasn't an easy road, but that's why I'm here.
Skin/Desc/1017004┃Ready for some fun and fiery combustion experiments?
Skin/Desc/1055003┃Someone got hurt over there! I hope there's blood...
Skin/Desc/1061002┃Mysterious Agent Irex! I accept payment in fish!
Skin/Desc/1039003┃Wish us luck on our journey together!
Skin/Desc/1046003┃Did you order coffee?
Skin/Desc/1063002┃I always pray that this nightmare will end...
Skin/Desc/1037003┃Your hair looks perfect today.
Skin/Desc/1070001┃Like a plum blossom blooming in the dark.
Skin/Desc/1011005┃Peace to the living, and rest to the dead.
Skin/Desc/1008004┃The march won't stop until we save the world with music!
Skin/Desc/1005003┃Money enriches the heart.\n<color=#FFBB00>[Voicelines Changed]</color>
Skin/Desc/1033004┃Please reach out to me if you find this person!
Skin/Desc/1058003┃Want to know what a pro's coffee tastes like?
Skin/Desc/1024003┃Master, today's schedule after breakfast is to practice chess with me.
Skin/Desc/1006004┃It's time to hunt evil!
Skin/Desc/1044003┃Bring it on! I'm not here to dawdle.

컬렉션 아이템 소모 체크박스┃I’ve read this and would like to use the item.
CharacterGuide/1┃Jackie's tactic is her Continuity of Choices. The ideal situation is to activate her Hack & Slash(Q) skill first. You can then deal extra damage to the enemies that are bleeding and recover HP from the lifesteal effect by using Adrenaline Burst (W). Use Leaping Strike (E) to make your enemies move slower right after Adrenaline Burst. You can also reduce the distance between you and the enemy by combining Adrenaline Burst and Leaping Strike.
CharacterGuide/2┃Aya is a long-distance character that requires different strategies depending on the weapon she has. Steady Shot (W) is a powerful skill, but it is hard to hit the enemy as you cannot change directions while using it. However, it is good when paired with Blank Cartridge (R), which makes the enemy stop. You can then suppress the enemy or shake them off by shooting in their direction while walking backwards.
CharacterGuide/3┃Fiora gains stacks of Touché (passive) for every basic attack, applying an indicator. She then attacks enemies by proccing the activated Touché indicator. To gain stacks of Touché quickly, you need to use Attaque Composée (W) often, as it allows you to perform basic attacks twice in a row. You can deal extra damage to enemies with full stacks by using Fente (Q) or Marche & Rompre (E).\nToggle her ultimate, Garde (R), to deal extra damage. When toggled, each attack uses SP, so keep an eye on it! 
CharacterGuide/4┃Magnus' main attack is 17 vs 1 (W). In order to maximize the effectiveness of this skill, you need to hit the opponent with Broken Bullet (Q), reducing their speed. Thanks to Tough Body (passive), Magnus also gets scarier every time he loses HP, making the 17 vs 1 (W) skill even stronger as it also increases his defense power. His ultimate, Bike From Hell, is a skill used for long-distance engagements, making it good for finishing off escaping enemies.
CharacterGuide/5┃\nWhen Zahir hits an enemy with one of his skills, it applies an Eye of Azrael (passive) indicator to them. There are specific Eye of Azrael effects for each skills, so when hitting an enemy that has the Eye of Azrael indicator, you will have enhanced combat potential thanks to the additional effects.\nZahir's skills are mostly skill shots, so it can be hard to hit the enemy. To make things easier, hit them first with Vayvayastra (E) to knock them airborne and then use Narayanastra (Q) or Gandiva (W). You have to acquire Chakrams to use Gandiva (W), but the cooldown is rather short, so you can deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time.\nHis ultimate, Bhargavastra (R), is a powerful attack in a certain range, so it is more effective when used with a debuff that prevents them from exiting that range.
CharacterGuide/6┃Nadine's strength is to be fast. If you use Monkey Wire (E) to increase your attack speed, you will be able to attack even faster. You can also reduce the enemy's movement speed with Squirrel Trap (W), keeping distance between you and them, turning the fight to your advantage.\nFor her ultimate, Wolf Assault, you need to slay a lot of wild animals. Slaying wild animals gives your more stacks of Wild & Clairvoyant (passive), which increases the damage dealt by the summoned wolf.
CharacterGuide/7┃Hyunwoo is a character with strong defense power. After increasing his defense with Bluff (W), you can reduce your enemy's defense by stunning them with First Attack (E), while gaining defense at the same time. If you succeeded in hitting the target with his ultimate skill, he deals the most damage in a short amount of time.
CharacterGuide/8┃Hart's attacks vary not only depending on her Skill Enhancements, but also depending on her <color=yellow>Skill Evolution</color> points, thus making strategic decisions is important. You can use apply a max of two Skill Evolution points per skill. Additional effects are applied to the skills depending on if the skill has been evolved. You gain 1 Skill Evolution point the first you craft an Uncommon, Rare, or Epic weapon, for a total of 3 points.\nHart's attack power increases with how long she charges her skill, Delay(Q). Hart is free to move around as she pleases while charging, so you can increase your attack power first with Overdrive (W), and follow it up with your charged sound wave or use it in combination with Flanger (E), which allows you to attack while moving.\nHer ultimate, Peacemaker(R), stops enemies from being able to fight for a moment. Use her ultimate after activating Delay(Q), charging your sound wave while enemies cannot fight. You can then attack them with a powerful sound wave, dealing damage while they are still dancing to the music.
CharacterGuide/9┃Isol excels at controlling the battlefield. The key to his playstyle is utilizing his MOK Operational Mines(R) to either expand your awareness and influence your enemies' movements or concentrate your area control into one lethal deathtrap.\n\nIsol's passive, Guerilla Warfare, enables impromptu placements of traps and reduces the defense of people that take damage from them, so expect your opponents to have detection and disarming drones. As time ticks down and the final zones approach, prepare yourself for a battle of resources and attrition.\n\nThere are two primary ways Isol goes on the offensive. Guerilla Warfare's defensive debuff applies to MOK Operational Mines, allowing Isol to tear through enemies if he focuses on his basic attacks. Alternatively, you can get items that lower your skill cooldowns increase the number of MOK Operational Mines you can have in a pile. Pairing a stack of MOK Mines with a movement-impairing trap makes for a cruel and effective ambush.\n\nAs destructive as Isol's MOK assault can be, he shines with his excellent awareness and evasion. Isol's mobility skill, Camouflage(E), cloaks him instantly so you can run and hide from your pursuers or cost them a camera. Use Sentex Bomb(Q) to scout bushes, lure enemies with a fake alert, or latch it onto an enemy for damage and crowd control. Following up Sentex Bomb with Rebel Assault(W) run-and-gun slow is an effective combo to chase or attack on the move, but try not to chase too hard! Isol is utilized best when he fights on his own battlefield.
CharacterGuide/10┃Li Dailin can use different strategies depending on how high her <color=yellow>BAC</color> is. \nDrink Up (W) temporarily boosts her basic attacks (Liquid Strength), while increasing her Blood Alcohol Content (BAC). If her BAC is above 40, Spirited Kick (Q), Bottom Shelf (E), Striking Tiger (R) reduce her BAC by a fixed amount, but she can deal a lot of damage when Tipsy is active. When consuming alcoholic drink items, she gets additional skill amplification and the duration of her Liquid Strength effect (increased basic attack damage) is extended. Consuming beverage items mid-fight is very effective.\nDrink Up (W) fills up your BAC, but be careful not to use it too often - Li Dailin cannot use her skills for a few seconds if she enters an Inebriated state. However, all her basic attacks are doubled while Inebriated state, so it might be useful when all your skills are in cooldown.
CharacterGuide/11┃Yuki deals additional damage and gains skill damage reduction depending on the number of cufflinks he has, which means that you should carefully manage his cufflinks. Yuki gains one cufflink automatically every 4 seconds, to a maximum of 4. You can also fill up your cufflinks with Button Up (W). Having a cufflink when using From Head to Toe (Q) stuns the enemy, increasing your chances to hit them with Dashing Gentleman (E) right after. On the other hand, if you use Dashing Gentleman (E) during the cooldown of From Head to Toe (Q), you can deal immediate damage with From Head to Toe (Q) right after dealing damage with Dashing Gentleman (E).\nWhen you max out the skill points of both Dashing Gentleman (E) and Button Up (W), you can use Dashing Gentleman (E) again immediately after using Button Up (W), making it possible to do a skill combo E-W-E.\nHis ultimate Coup de Grace (R) is effective for finishing off enemies or reducing the distance between you and them as it attacks in a wide range and has movement speed reduction effects.
CharacterGuide/12┃Hyejin can launch very powerful attacks quickly.\nYou can use Charm of Despair (Q) twice quickly, reducing your enemy's movement speed and allowing you to hit them with your other skills.\nCharm of the Prophecy (W) takes some time to activate, but it has a wide range, so it is good paired with the fear effect from Three Calamities (Passive), or when placed ahead in an area you don't have vision of.\nCharm of the Nomad (E) can be coupled with both charges of Cham of Despair (Q) to trigger the fear effect of Three Calamities (Passive), as a final blow, or as an escape that can teleport her over large sections of terrain.\nHer ultimate, Five Omens (R), not only deals damage after she focuses for a short time, but also allows for easy activation of her Three Calamities (Passive) thanks to the five omens that she summons around her.\nHyejin is able to control zones thanks to her strong skill combo, allowing her to ambush enemies and fear them without giving them time to respond.
CharacterGuide/13┃Collecting materials for not only equipment, but also for food and beverages, is very important for Xiukai because of his passive: Juggernaut Chef.\nWhen Xiukai makes food or drink, they have higher HP/SP, and will also increase his max HP (depending on rarity). While all of his skills cost HP, the more HP he has, the more damage he deals.\nXiukai's skills Heavy Meal (W), Wok It Off (E), and Burnt to a Crisp (R) apply extra damage and effects if the enemy has impaired movement, so it is important to combo those skills with Lost in the Sauce (Q).\nAfter using Lost in the Sauce (Q), try sliding to an enemy with Wok It Off (E) to knock them up. Use Heavy Meal (W) right after to slow them, and follow up with Burnt to a Crisp (R) to reduce their defense and deal a final blow. \nIf Xiukai continuously crafts food, he can have an extraordinarily high max HP level and easily take out his enemies to be the last survivor. 
CharacterGuide/14┃Chiara is a versatile character capable of both offensive and defensive playstyles. \n\nMania (E) throws out a tether that latches onto the first target it hits. Maintaining this tether restricts their movement. This allows you to stick to your enemies or escape from difficult situations.\n\nDepraved Prayer (W) gives a shield that temporarily increases Chiara's HP. Depraved Prayer may also be used right before a fight so that it may be reactivated to deal damage immediately.\n\nHand of Corruption (Q) can be used in a cone-shaped form or charged to shoot in a line. Try to utilize Hand of Corruption to slow an enemy, making it easier to hit Mania (E), or to get away from an enemy.\n\nStigma (Passive) reduces the defense of enemies for each stack applied. Every time that she hits an enemy with a skill, it applies a stack of Stigma, up to four. In conjunction with the skill damage applied from Plague (R), Chiara can reduce the defense of multiple enemies at once. At four stacks of Stigma, she also gains movement speed.\n\nPlague (R) causes Chiara's basic attacks to become temporarily ranged. Enemies inside of Plague's area of effect take skill damage every second, applying Stigma. In addition, when a player or animal has four stacks of Stigma on them, Chiara gains vision of them and may recast her R to end Plague and descend upon them dealing massive damage. A good usage of this is to close distance on a fleeing target. If the recast kills the target, the cooldown of Chiara's ultimate is reduced by 50%. \n\nChiara is at her strongest while using Plague. Enemies will run from her while she has it active! Be careful deciding when you want to use Plague, knowing when to go all-in is a skill best learned through experience. Now go and make the sinners of Lumia Island repent for their transgressions!\n\n
CharacterGuide/15┃Sissela specializes in dodging attacks and controlling enemies.\nAgony (Passive) will give her a good boost in battles. As her HP decreases, Sissela gains HP regeneration and extra skill damage.\nYou can put space between you and your enemies by sending out Wilson with Go Get 'Em, Wilson! (Q) to attack them for you.\nGirl in a Bubble (W) makes Sissela invulnerable. It also does some damage and pushes enemies back once it's over. \nYou can manipulate the battlefield thanks to Play With Us! (E). Not only can it be used to pull enemies, but can also be used to pull teammates or Sissela herself.\nHer ultimate, Free at Last (R), deals damage to players nearby and in the same area- including Sissela herself. Sissela can out damage enemies by avoiding attacks first with Girl in a Bubble (W) and increasing her stats with her passive before using her ultimate. \nCalculating when to use her skills is very important with Sissela. She becomes even more useful in teams.
CharacterGuide/16┃Silvia has different skills depending on if she's walking or on her motorcycle. She can ride her motorcycle once she reaches level 6 and has enough fuel. While not on the bike, she receives fuel passively, when she hits enemies, or moves to new zones. She cannot use basic attacks or weapon skills while riding her bike, but her movement speed increases. Driving in the same direction gradually increases her movement speed -- changing direction slows her down. Lumia Grand Prix (Passive) permanently increases her attack speed and skill amplification each time she enters a new zone. If she visits all 15 zones, she gains attack speed and skill amplification. \nWhen she's not on her bike, her skills revolve mainly around keeping her enemies at a distance by slowing them down or knocking them back. Radar Gun (Q) heals her allies and launching the Spare Tire (E) further away deals more damage. \nThe skills on her bike focus on getting close to her enemies. She can knock them airborne with Front Flip (W) or knock them back with Wheelie (E). \nSilvia can win in both up close and at a distance if she uses her skills right. She can get stronger by riding her motorcycle and travelling around Lumia when her fuel is full, allowing her to take the checkered flag.
CharacterGuide/17┃Adriana is a control mage who uses long-ranged skills and leaves burning areas on the map.\nWith Pyromaniac (Passive), Adriana deals damage over time to enemies inside burning areas and recovers SP.\nThrow flames in a specific direction with Flamethrower (Q), dealing damage to enemies, and allowing you to keep fighting while maintaining distance.\nOil Slick (W) is Adriana's key skill. You can use the skill twice to create oil slicks. Enemies in oil slicks have their movement speed reduced and are unable to use any movement skill, allowing you to ground them in one location. You can also light on fire the oil slicks to create a burning area and deal damage over time.\nAs Adriana can charge in the targeted direction with Fire Escape (E), this skill is even more efficient when used with Oil Slick (W) to juke your enemies or chase them while also creating burning areas.\nAdriana can use Cocktail Party (R) up to 3 times to create burning areas and knock back enemies.\nShe excels at dealing continuous damage and easily controlling small areas like the last restricted area (safe zone).\nTake advantage of her long-ranged attacks and control the map to your advantage, and soon you'll be dominating the whole island with Adriana's fireworks.
CharacterGuide/18┃Use the short cooldowns of Shoichi's skills to expertly dodge enemy attacks and use his movement to deal with enemies.\nPhony Deal (Passive) increases Shoichi's critical strike chance as he hits enemies, and increases his basic attack damage when reaching 5 stacks. \nGood Faith (Q) is a unique skill. Hitting an enemy with it allows you to use Bad Faith, giving you increased range and a convenient dagger on the ground.\nBottom Line (W) is the main strength of Shoichi - his movement. Dash to an enemy or dagger and reset your Bottom Line cooldown if you pick up a dagger. \nWith Risky Business (E), Shoichi takes a step back and throws a dagger, leaving a dagger behind the enemy, making it a breeze to use Bottom Line (W) just after it.\nRuthless (R) deals AOE damage and leaves 4 daggers on the ground around him, making the terrain favorable to Shoichi.\nShoichi's skills can be connected easily thanks to his ability to leave daggers on the ground, and taking advantage of Phony Deal (Passive) will allow you to show your enemies the business. \nConnecting skills, precise control, and good judgement are keys to playing Shoichi efficiently.
CharacterGuide/19┃Emma is a skill reliant character who uses flexible and complex skill combinations. Being able to find answers in many different situations making her both a mobile and versatile powerhouse. Use Dove Dealer (Q) with Hat Trick (W) to poke your opponents from afar. Her Bunnymorph (E) is great for interrupting skills, chasing your target, and buying time for her skills to go off cooldown. CheerUP♥ (Passive) gives you a shield and empowers your next basic attack, making it a fantastic combo filler or even way to catch your opponents off guard. Change★ (R) is the most complex but enabling part of her kit, allowing Emma to confuse and displace her opponents by switching places with her Dove to root any test subject in the way. She can also switch with her Hat, pulling in all unfortunate enemies that happen to be on top of her, leaving them vulnerable to follow-up. Due to the nature of this skill being so flexible, there are many different combinations and combos for each situation. Utilize Emma's aggressive and defensive plays and use all the tricks up her sleeve to turn fights and make Lumia's residents nothing but her deceived audience!
CharacterGuide/20┃Lenox uses her whip to face enemies from any distance she pleases. With Recoil(Q), she can deal more damage to enemies that she puts space between. With Snakebite (W), she can damage enemies near her in a circle, slowing them, or attack enemies from afar, silencing them and increases her own movement speed. With Whiplash (E), she can push or pull enemies, allowing her to take full advantage of her Recoil (Q) and Snakebite (W). Enemies hit with Blue Viper (R) take damage when they move, meaning they either have to stand and face Lenox, or run and take damage. Lenox enjoys fishing - but when a fight breaks out, she'll be ready stop her enemies from moving. She ain't afraid to break their kneecaps, either. 
CharacterGuide/21┃Rozzi attacks enemies with flashy and quick movements. Her Passive, Dual Wield, allows her to use her basic attack twice, plus she gets some tasty extra recovery when she eats or drinks things made out of chocolate. \nEasy Shot (Q) is her main skill. Rozzi fires a skillshot. If she hits an enemy, her next movement command becomes a quick dash. \nFlutter(W) reduces the defense of enemies and hinders their HP recovery. It also reloads her ammo, so she can continue the barrage even when she's short on bullets. \nGun Vault (E) allows Rozzi to avoid getting targeted and taking damage, all while putting space between her and her enemy. She can use the skill again to push an enemy back, creating even more distance!\nRozzi can slow enemies by attaching her Semtex Bomb Mk-II (R) to them. If the bomb is attached, it's high time to attack her enemy and make it explode sooner.\nRozzi likes to stay at a distance, but because her skills have a short range, she has to get close and move quick to dodge attacks and secure kills. Her outplay potential is high and her flashy-ness is even higher; let's see what you can do.
CharacterGuide/22┃Luke gains skill effects based on his <color=yellow>Skill Evolution</color> so it opens up more ability customization! He gains Skill Evolution points by slaying test subjects, wild animals, Alpha/Omega, and Wickeline, or opening air supplies, and can use these points to evolve up to 3 skills. \nNeat 'n Tidy (Passive) is two parts. Neat heals him after killing things, like animals and players, and he gains Tidy stacks to put towards his evolution points.\nClean Sweep (Q) is Luke's most important skill. He throws a bottle of his favorite cleaning product in a targeted direction and can reactivate it to dash to them!\nElbow Grease (W) has a nice passive that reduces the duration of slow on him. Activate it to smack your enemies for extra damage and gain some attack speed!\nDirty Work (E) lets Luke stay hidden by supressing pings he makes on the minimap. Activate it to teleport behind your enemy and deal some damage with his pistol! Nothin' personal, kid.\nPressure Washer(R) turns Luke's trusty cleaning tools into a deadly weapon, shooting a massive bullet in the targeted direction and dealing damage to enemies.\nLuke's Clean Sweep (Q) allows him to rush towards enemies hit. Even through walls! Attacks enhanced by Elbow Grease (W) can deal big damage to a single target, especially with the attack speed ramped up. \nDirty Work (E) helps Luke, well, stay silent. You get some nice Skill Evolution Points to pick and choose your skills to make them a little stronger. Pressure Washer (R) deals damage based on missing HP, so he can execute anyone trying to run and hide from their cleaning.\nYou can always count on Luke and Double L cleaning to keep Lumia Island in tip-top shape!
CharacterGuide/23┃Cathy uses her surgical tools to wound enemies and deal even more damage to those already wounded. \nCathy's Passive has two parts: Under the Knife & Post-op. Under the Knife allows Cathy to apply a stack of Wounded to enemies with skills. However, upon reaching 5 stacks, enemies are Severely Wounded and really start to feel the pain. Cathy deals additional critical strike damage to Severely Wounded enemies.\nPost-op: Hitting enemies with a skill grants her a shield, absorbing damage for a few seconds and increasing her movement speed.\nUse Double Bypass (Q) to dash in the targeted direction, dealing damage to enemies hit. She can also Wound enemies with her next basic attack after using a skill. If Cathy Severely Wounds an enemy, the cooldown of Double Bypass is reduced, opening up opportunity for her to pull off some sick combos. \nAmputation (W) has two "ranges": close range and the outer cone. Enemies hit by the outer cone are grounded them for a moment, preventing them from using movement skills.\nSuture (E) is a strong skill, prime to help Cathy take on multiple enemies at the same time. Cathy throws her suture thread, dealing damage to the first enemy hit and rooting them for a few seconds.Threads can also pass through and hit another enemy, pulling them together, dealing damage and stunning them for a few seconds. If the thread passes through and hits a wall, it'll push the enemy to the wall, dealing damage and stunning them for a few seconds.\nEmergency Surgery (R) is great offensively and for helping your team.

You could also pop into some team matches and be the killer support you've always dreamt of. \nCathy will make them regret they ever called the doctor in the first place.
CharacterGuide/24┃Adela treats her opponents as her pawns. Her passive, Control the Center gives her longer range than other rapier wielders, at the cost of her inability to increase her attack speed. Attack speed is converted to attack power. Promotion (Q) allows Adela to summon a actual pawn with a very short cooldown. Consecutive uses will summon a Queen, stunning enemies. Knight Fork (W) summons a Knight to attack her enemies, and can also manipulate her other pieces to deal additional damage and knock enemies airborne. Castling (E) uses the Rook to attack enemies and grant Adela the ability to switch positions with her rook. When Rook attacks, other pieces on the way also cause damage. Checkmate (R) causes Adela to rise into the air and make her untargetable. Upon landing, she deals damage to enemies nearby. Her pieces deal damage, too! Adela is great at staying at a distance and using her pieces to deal continuous damage to her enemies.

When danger, use Casling or Checkmate to get out and reset the chess board. Show them the true grandmaster with Adela’s impressive tactics.
CharacterGuide/25┃Bernice specializes in marking and tracking his beasts.\nBuckshot (Passive) is short range but it fires multiple bullets at the same time, giving Bernice destructive force in close range and allowing him to deal damage to multiple enemies.\nLeg Shot (Q) fires a sharp-edged bullet, reducing the movement speed of enemies hit. If your enemy is rooted, like with a Foothold Trap or an Explosive Bola, they take even more damage. Foothold Trap (W) roots enemies that step on it and makes them bleed. Falconry (E) has a good passive and active. The passive marks enemies that are rooted by Foothold Trap (W). Activating Falconry gives him better vision and marks nearby enemies. Marked enemies are more visible to Bernice and he moves faster towards them. Hitting the marked baddies with a basic attack reduces the cooldown of Leg Shot and Explosive Bola. Explosive Bola (R) roots and deals damage to enemies hit. After the root, the bola explodes, dealing damage to the enemy and spreads to other enemies nearby, rooting them as well. Working around Foothold Trap (W) is a favorable play for Bernice. He can get close to enemies and deal big damage with Buckshot by moving super fast towards them. Use Explosive Bola to root your target and then smack them with Leg Shot to get that extra damage. You can't run but you can't hide from Bernice.
CharacterGuide/26┃Barbara is a versatile character that fights alongside her Sentry Gun. She has separate sets of basic and enhanced skills. Retrofit (Passive) enhances her Sentry Gun and increases her attack speed every time Sentry Gun is hit by one of her skills. BT Sentry Gun Mk.II (Q) summons a Sentry Gun that automatically targets and deals damage to enemies. Free-Electron Laser (W) deals damage to enemies shot and slows them. If Barbara shoots a Sentry Gun with Free-Electron Laser, the Sentry Gun will fire an extra laser at an enemy. Barbara can create a Magnetic Cyclone (E) around her, which increases her movement speed and deals damage over time to enemies in a radius. If Magnetic Cyclone damages an enemy, Barbara will gain a shield depending on the damage dealt. Barbara can reactivate Magnetic Cyclone to slow enemies hit by both cyclones. Overclock (R) enhances all of Barbara's basic skills, transforming them into Short Circuit (Q), Photon Resonance (W), and Particle Storm (E).

Barbara's new tech ain't nothin' to mess with.
CharacterGuide/27┃Infiltration (Passive) hides Alex so enemies cannot see you outside of his detection radius starting from level 6. He also gains weapon mastery for all his weapon types evenly. EMP Barrage (R) is a long range, multipurpose skill that can help you snipe and slow faraway enemies. Depending on his held weapon type (Melee/Ranged), Alex's skills will have different effects. Gauss Pistol (Ranged Q) increases his attack power when he hits enemies. Recognition Signal (Ranged W) grants vision of enemies hit, and increases his range temporarily if there are enemies hit.

Odyssey (Q) is a long ranged ability that can be used to initiate fights. Hitting an enemy with any part of it places a Bookmark on them, and landing Odyssey on an enemy that has a Bookmark deals extra damage. The center strip of the ability stuns, which can be the perfect opportunity to follow up with Don Quixote (E). Bookmarked enemies take more damage from Don Quixote and are knocked airborne instead of being slowed. Don Quixote can also cover significant distance quickly, perfect for making a great escape.\nThe Curious Case (W) has two functions. When cast on an enemy, it blinds them, causing their auto attacks to miss. When cast on an ally or on yourself, it grants a shield, making you or your ally unstoppable, preventing a lot of CC! Well-timed usage of The Curious Case can make a world difference!\nSua's ultimate, Memory (R), recasts a stronger version of the spell she used. Memory of Odyssey is great for locking people down, Memory of Don Quixote can cover even greater distance to escape or run down enemies, and Memory of The Curious Case can prevent even more damage from enemies!\n...Now to find where I put my Lumia Library card... maybe she'll lend me some of Aesop's Fables\n

Dealing damage with one of these extra strength attacks creates a pool near his enemy. Stand on that for some buffs or escape with his Duck Dive (E). He's slippery when wet. \nSpeaking of Duck Dive (E), Leon can use it to pop out of any pool of his choosing. When he pops out of it, he does damage and knocks up his enemies. He can use it to go over walls, too! He must've been practicing his butterfly stroke.\nWith Surf's Up (R), Leon rides a sick wave and gets pitted, sweeping away enemies in his path. Enemies are knocked back until the wave dissipates, and enemies that hit a wall are slowed and take damage. \nLeon doesn't want to get out of the pool, he's much stronger in them. He can create pools with both Waterway(Q) and Cannonball (W) to position himself strategically (or run) with Duck Dive(E). Combining all of these with Surf's Up (R) will surely make his opponents feel underwater.
CharacterGuide/30┃Eleven doubles as both a strong initiator and a fighter with incredible sustained damage potential.\nGround Beef (P) drops a slider on the ground after hitting consecutive autos. Eating it grants her some HP and the ability to activate any of her enhanced skills instantly.\nBurger Queen (Q) allows Eleven to deal damage and slow their enemies when it's enhanced. It is best used to continue chasing, as the slow will allow you to stick to your opponent for a longer period of time.\nFood For Thought (W) is an AOE CC ability that allows Eleven to both start and continue fights. It is best used after activating Calorie Cyclone to keep her opponents stuck inside of her raging food cyclone. Once they’re taunted, deal as much damage as possible!\nOn Air! (E) allows Eleven to run away - or to close the gap. It’s most potent when enhanced under the effects of a slider, as it lets her jump to any distance up to 12m without the need for any charge up! She can use this to catch opponents off guard and get on top of them, or to run away without the chance to stop her.\nCalorie Cyclone (R) will give Eleven an enhanced skill and greatly increase her damage. Once you are close to your opponent, pop this skill and start beating up your enemy with that massive fork of yours.\nAlso don't forget to cook up some #11 Combo Meals for you and your friends. They're delicious and really heal you!
CharacterGuide/31┃Rio’s got a couple bows in her arsenal that she can swap between, depending on what she's up against.\nHer passive, Hassetsu reduces her target’s defense based on her Critical Strike Chance. She can't deal critical strikes, but she still gets damaged based on her critical strike chance and skill amplification. She is a flexible and versatile archer with strengths regardless of the critical strike chance and skill amplification of her items. \nRio’s Kyudo Instinct(Q) allows her to swap bows. Her hankyu deals less damage but can attack quickly and continuously with 2 arrows. With her daikyu, she fires one single powerful arrow that is slower but deals more damage.\nShe also gets an extra effect applied to her next attack or skill after dealing damage to three targets with her skills or basic attacks. With her Hankyu, she gets increased movement and attack speed for a moment. Using her daikyu increases her damage dealt proportional to her enemy’s missing HP. It slows them too! \nHanare(W) allows Rio to fire multiple arrows in a cone while using her Hankyu, leaving behind a small breeze that slows enemies. With her daikyu, she fires a single but powerful arrow that pierces targets, dealing damage, and reducing its cooldown.\nWith Soar(E), Rio jumps into the air and fires her arrows down towards her enemies. Soaring with her hankyu, she fires 2 arrows at enemies. With her daikyu, she can deal extra damage in an area. Damaging enemies also reduces its cooldown!\nLike the rest of her skills, Rio has a different ultimate ability with a bow. With her hankyu, Rio uses Fleeting Soul to fire multiple arrows in the direction. Each deals damage and lowers the cooldown of Fleeting Soul/Spirit Arrow. An extra one at the end knocks enemies back. If they're hit into a wall, they're stunned.\nWith her daikyu, Rio stabilizes herself and fires a Spirit Arrow in the targeted direction, dealing damage and slowing enemies. The further the arrow flies, the more damage it does!\n\n
CharacterGuide/32┃William, Lumia's Ace Pitcher, is ready to throw some curveballs! He pegs his enemies with baseballs and can pick up balls that bounce off them to get an upper hand in battles.\n\nWith No Hitter(Passive), William's basic attacks cause a ball to bounce off enemies. When he walks towards one, his movement speed is increased and picking it up will cause his next basic attack to deal extra damage. No Hitter will stack up to 3, allowing him to use Fastball(Q) when fully stacked. 3 strikes and they're out, am I right?\n\nFastball(Q) gives him an attack speed boost and he'll throw an additional ball at enemies to deal extra damage.\n\nWindup(W) allows William to create a pitcher's mound around him that knocks enemies back, and pitches a baseball that returns to him, dealing damage and slowing enemies. Enemies that are hit by the ball both on the way out and on the way back are stunned. While standing on the mound, William's attack range is increased and No Hitter balls will return to him.\n\nSliding Catch(E) will let William slide to the targeted baseball. When he picks up a baseball, William's defense is increased for a short time.\n\nWith Signature Fireball(R), William leaps into the air and throws his signature fireball to the targeted area, dealing damage and slowing enemies. Four balls bounce out from the center after impact.\n\nWilliam can pick up the baseballs to increase his power or use sliding catch to keep his enemies on their toes.

CharacterGuide/19/DirectFire┃<color=orange>Shuriken</color> have more difficult recipes for high tier weapons compared to throwing weapons, but have a higher attack power on average. The weapon skill, Caltrops, stays on the ground for a long time, allowing for more favorable fights and spacing enemies so that they cannot get closer to you.
CharacterGuide/20/Whip┃<color=orange>Whips</color> are a "melee" weapon with a long range, allowing you to maintain distance with your enemies when you fight. The weapon skill, Grappling Whip, can help you start a battle or rope in an enemy trying to escape by pulling them towards you. 
CharacterGuide/21/Pistol┃<color=orange>Pistols</color> do not have a long range but they provide good survivability. The pistol weapon skill, Moving Reload, increases the movement speed of the user for a moment while reloading ammo.
CharacterGuide/22/Bat┃<color=orange>Bats</color> allow for quick attacks. Couple the attack speed of bats with the extra damage from Elbow Grease (W) to really scrub away the dirt. Look for favorable terrain and use the bat skill, Full Swing, well and stun your enemy - making it even easier to ramp up your attacks.
CharacterGuide/23/OneHandSword┃<color=orange>Daggers</color> are powerful for instant attacks. You can disappear for a moment and reappear again with the Cloak and Dagger skill to deal cellular damage.
CharacterGuide/24/Rapier┃<color=orange>Rapiers</color> can quickly attack the enemy, dealing even more damage if you perform a powerful critical blow. Quickly charge toward the enemy with the weapon skill Quick Cut, closing in on the enemy and dealing damage.
CharacterGuide/25/SniperRifle┃<color=orange>Snipers</color> require good use of telephoto cameras and traps in order to take advantage of the vision range and long distance of the Sniper Rifles. Predict the movement of your enemies and you can snipe them at a very long distance with the Sniper skill.
CharacterGuide/26/Bat┃<color=orange>Bats</color> allow for quick attacks. You can push your enemies back with a Full Swing to keep them away from you... and your precious sentry gun.  
CharacterGuide/27/Pistol┃<color=orange>Pistols</color> do not have a long range but they provide good survivability. The pistol weapon skill, Moving Reload, increases the movement speed of the user for a moment while reloading ammo.
CharacterGuide/27/DirectFire┃<color=orange>Shuriken</color> have more difficult recipes for high tier weapons compared to throwing weapons, but have a higher attack power on average. The weapon skill, Caltrops, stays on the ground for a long time, allowing for more favorable fights and spacing enemies so that they cannot get closer to you.
CharacterGuide/27/TwoHandSword┃<color=orange>Two-handed Swords</color> are weaker than other weapons in the first half of the match but get really powerful in the second half. The weapon skill Parry can block the enemy's main attack once, so it becomes even scarier in the second half.
CharacterGuide/27/Tonfa┃<color=orange>Tonfas</color> are weapons with low attack power but with high defense, giving you higher survivability. If you time Quick Spin correctly, your enemies might regret attacking you in the first place...
CharacterGuide/28/Hammer┃<color=orange>Hammers</color> are weapons with strong attack power. The Armor Piercing weapon skill has a defense power reduction effect, so you can quickly suppress enemies with low defense power.
CharacterGuide/29/Glove┃<color=orange>Gloves</color> often boast quick attack speed, allowing Leon to create pools quicker with his Cannonball. Couple that with Uppercut, and things start to look good for the waterbug.
CharacterGuide/30/Hammer┃<color=orange>Hammers</color> are weapons with strong attack power. The Armor Piercing weapon skill has a defense power reduction effect, so you can quickly suppress enemies with low defense power.
CharacterGuide/31/Bow┃<color=orange>Bows</color> have rather low attack power, but fast attack speed. The weapon skill Rain of Arrows is hard to master because of its delay , but you can deal big damage and slow down your enemies if you get it right.
CharacterGuide/32/HighAngleFire┃<color=orange>Throw</color> weapons go well with William, who likes to sling out basic attacks. Smokescreen, the weapon skill, reduces the enemy's vision and movement speed, giving William some defensive options but can also allow him to be a little aggressive with it.
CharacterGuide/33/Glove┃<color=orange>Gloves</color> enable quick jabs, giving an Enraged Nicky the opportunity to deal big damage multiple times.
CharacterGuide/34/Camera┃<color=orange>Cameras</color> have a slow attack speed but will deal instant damage the moment you press the shutter release. It'll also blind enemies that are facing you, maybe giving you the upperhand in some sticky situations.
CharacterGuide/35/Glove┃<color=orange>Gloves</color> have fast attack speed and allow Jan to weave together skills and basic attacks to deal continuous damage.\n\n
CharacterGuide/36/HighAngleFire┃<color=orange>Throw</color> weapons are effective at a range, making them work well with Eva who likes to fight (and open boxes) from a distance. Smokescreen both slows and reduces vision which gives Eva extra survivability and opportunity to chain her skills together.
CharacterGuide/37/OneHandSword┃<color=orange>Daggers</color> are powerful when bursting down your enemies. You can disappear for a moment and reappear again with the Cloak and Dagger skill to deal cellular damage. Used consecutively with Shadow Glide, you can deftly avoid your enemy's skills while dealing tons of damage.
CharacterGuide/38/Pistol┃<color=orange>Pistols</color> do not have a long range but they provide good survivability. The pistol weapon skill, Moving Reload, increases the movement speed of the user for a moment while reloading ammo.

Also, activating a security console that is not occupied by an ally will grant you a small amount of Credits,\n\nOn the other hand, if the CCTV is moving closer to you and blinking red, that means someone is watching you instead! Run for it!
gameTip_Title_10071_1┃Hyperloop & VLS
gameTip_Desc_10071_1┃Big changes are coming to the Hyperloop system.\nStarting on Day 3, the new VLS transportation devices will be available in Safe Zones, while Hyperloops will be dynamically activated in Restricted Areas.\nUnlike Hyperloops, the VLS allows movement by "gliding" within a certain radius.
gameTip_Title_10071_2┃Hyperloop
gameTip_Desc_10071_2┃Did someone say, FAST TRAVEL?\n\nIt may look like a broken down phone booth, but this booth allows you to travel anywhere on Lumia Island thanks to Hyperloop technology. You can also tap on a <color=#8FDBF8>teammate's picture</color> to be teleported directly to them!\n\n*Hyperloop Usage Precautions*\nYou may accidentally run into enemies after teleporting. Be careful!
gameTip_Title_10071_3┃VLS
gameTip_Desc_10071_3┃Unlike Hyperloops, the VLS isn't designed for long-distance travel but enables synchronized gliding with allies.\nWhile you're gliding, the ground becomes visible below a certain altitude, making it excellent for scouting.\nLanding after gliding triggers a brief area-wide stun, making it useful for initiating.\nOnly the Host can control the gliding, with allies relying on the Host for synchronized movement. At a certain altitude, allies can break away from the Host and move freely.

gameTip_Desc_10100_1┃If you're in a Restricted Area marked in red, you better get out of there, stat!

When the timer reaches 0, you can kiss your life goodbye.\n\nYou can restore the detonation timer by killing other test subjects, but it's better for you not to be there at all.\n\n"Soon the Test Subject will explode!"
gameTip_Title_10110_1┃Temporary Safe Zone
gameTip_Desc_10110_1┃When the last safe zone is designated as a Restricted Area, two temporary safe zones are created if <color=#8FDBF8>3 or more survivors</color> are still alive.\n\nThe detonation timer won't tick down if your team is inside the safe zone. On the other hand, if 2 or more teams are in the temporary safe zone, or if they leave the temporary safe zone, the detonation timer begins ticking again.\n\nIt's a piece of cake. Keep your team in the temporary safe zone, and drive out any enemies to stay alive!
gameTip_Title_10120_1┃Final Safe Zone
gameTip_Desc_10120_1┃The final safe zone is a place to determine the ultimate winner.\n\nThe final safe zone is placed around the security console in the last Restricted Area. As the detonation timer works everywhere except the safe zone, you have to fight and win.\n\nIf the final safe zone is activated and there is no winner after a certain amount of time, all safe zones will be discarded and the detonation timer begins ticking for everyone. This is your time to defeat the enemy and claim first place!
gameTip_Title_10130_1┃Auto Revive
gameTip_Desc_10130_1┃Died? Don't give up just yet!\n\nIf your teammates are still alive, you will auto-revive until Night 2. An enemy guarding your dead body? No problem - you can choose the spot to respawn. A place close to your team should be safe... right?
gameTip_Title_10140_1┃Downed / Slain
gameTip_Desc_10140_1┃Test subjects on Lumia Island become downed when they are first slain. When down, you can only move or discard items, and your detonation timer and HP drop even if you stand still.\n\nIf you die again while down, your dead body will be left behind. You can grab items left from dead test subjects. If you hunt a test subject that has a Legendary item, you can earn a large amount of Credits through bounty items.
gameTip_Title_10140_2┃Downed Skill
gameTip_Desc_10140_2┃Don't give up when you're downed!\nThere are some special skills that can only be used while downed!\n\nThere are a total of 3 Downed Skills:\n1. <color=#8FDBF8>Obstinacy</color>, which temporarily increases movement speed while downed. \n2. <color=#8FDBF8>Fission Blast</color>, which makes test subjects to self-destruct.\n3. <color=#8FDBF8>AED</color>, which allows test subjects to self-revive after a certain amount of time.\n\nCreate a more diverse gameplay by strategically using Downed Skills!
gameTip_Title_10150_1┃Air Supply Box
gameTip_Desc_10150_1┃Are you out of food? Or maybe you didn't craft the equipment you need? If so, look for the Air Supply Box on the map!\n\nYou can get food from a food box, more powerful materials from an Air Supply Box, and Legendary equiment in a legendary-level box. Open up the box and hope what you need is inside!\n\nDon't miss out when warnings of where and when the reward boxes will drop appear on the minimap.
gameTip_Title_10160_1┃Level / Skill
gameTip_Desc_10160_1┃Use the points you gain to level up and use stronger skills!\n\nWhen you obtain a certain level of mastery, the test subject's "level" increases. As level goes up, so do stats. Gain skill points to use even stronger skills\n\nLevel up and become as strong as you can!
gameTip_Title_10170_1┃Augments
gameTip_Desc_10170_1┃You can add new skills and buffs to your test subjects by selecting Augments.\n\nAugments allow more variety and options. For example, using Fortification Augments will increase Defense and reduce Damage. If you use Support Augments, you may be able to help your teammates and lead them to victory!\n\nDon't know which Augments are better suited for your test subjects? Check them out in the <color=#8FDBF8>[Loadout → Augments Menu]</color>!
gameTip_Title_10200_1┃Battle Zone
gameTip_Desc_10200_1┃Battle Zones are special areas purposefully made for battle. Their purpose is collecting data on test subjects that show up in these extreme environments.\n\nEach Battle Zone has a special environment.
